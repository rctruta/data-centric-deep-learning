I never bought any because of the price, and, I am not all that self conscious about my balding anyway.  However when a good friend of mine got some for his thinning hair I was so impressed by how it good it looked that I begged him to let me use it just once.  The color wasn't exactly right but that didn't matter since it was only a test... Unfortunately I have to say that even though it worked very well on my friends hair that is only thinning, it was a total bomb for me who has a real beach head coming in on the top.  Quite simply, one has to pay very close attention to the description of how this stuff says it works.  It clearly states that it needs or works by bonding with your existing hair.  If you have either no, or hardly any existing hair, it just comes out looking like a lot of very homely fuzzy stuff.  I tried it all over the top of my head and it simply stuck to it, and then ended up looking like some kind of very short, fuzzy, sparsely covered type dog hair.  Very ugly and fake looking and not at all worth the price or the bother for sure....\n\nAs for how it worked for my friend I have nothing but praise.  It was amazing the way it blended in and stuck to what thinning hair he had and combed out looking completely natural.  If you really want to see how this stuff looks in use, type the name of it into google and go to videos.  There are several online that depict a true demonstration of how good this stuff works on thinning hair.  Even on very thinning hair.  But not a one I found showed someone with a real Dr. Phil look, or even just a completely bare bald spot.  Without some minimal hair to cling to you are like me, fresh out of luck and too late.  If my hair was only thinning I would consider the hefty price of this worth it I believe.  Just remember for the truly bald, its a bust...\n\nIn conclusion, I decided to take off one star on the rating simply because I feel that despite this working very well on thinning hair, I believe that the description should more forcefully state that its not for bald heads. I don't think it does clearly enough to satisfy me. Not even the manufacturers web site that has a more detailed description says anything about bald heads.  Personally I feel that the majority of the negative reviews of it comes from those that are too far ahead with hair loss and just came out with a big fail on their part.  It was with me for sure.  Highly recommended only  for those with thinning hair that this stuff can cling too, and that feel hiding it well is worth the price... : )"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-56091", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I LIKED IT, HOWEVER IT BURNS YOUR EYES SOMETIMES IF YOU APPLIED ON THE WRONG PLACE LOL"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-64188", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I quit buying this product because it would stop working after using it about 10 times.

It is a thick cream consistency and slightly greasy to the touch.  Since I had already washed and dried my hair I tried it by using it more as a leaving in conditioner rather than washing it out.  The product worked immediately and made my blonde, dried out, frizzy, hair smooth and supple.

The bristles are gentle on the skin, yet provide a thorough, deep pore cleansing.  The rotating head vibrates enough to be effecting, but not so fast that it feels like a grinding wheel and the entire package is easy to hold in your palm.  Great for control and being easy to reach all the areas of your face. The motor is powerful and does not get bogged down and the charge lasts a really long time. It has two speeds - one for extra gentle - but she rarely uses this speed.  Plus the entire package is waterproof.  To charge, just rest it in the cradle charger provided.\n\nMy wife like to use her preferred cleanser (not a bar of soap). Her recommendation is to keep the brush head clean and dry when not in use.  In other words, don't use it, put it down and just walk away.  Keep the head clean and make sure it dries really well between use.  She sets hers bristle down on a folded sheet of paper towel.

And it burned my eyes a little. Must wash off after 10 mins, it leaves a sticky film. Not a terrible, but not my favorite.\n\nI tried four products, including this one, each for two weeks, 1x per day after face wash at bedtime. Here are the other three I tried:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/L-Occitane-Immortelle-Eye-Balm-0-5-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B005PTZWUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">L'Occitane Immortelle Eye Balm, 0.5 Fluid Ounce</a>\nAlmost immediately, I noticed reduced puffiness, increased firmness, and much more even tone. It smells great, like all their products, and moisturizes like a dream!  The skin under my eyes has never ever felt SO SMOOTH and wrinkle free. I started using it on a couple other spots on my face because it minimizes wrinkles so well. Dark circles appeared lessened because of improved hydration, tone, etc.  This one was my clear winner.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Womens-Eye-Contour-Serum/dp/B0087CRJDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Womens Eye Contour Serum</a>\nBright white and thicker cream has virtually zero scent. It is very gentle and felt like nothing at all, so I wore this one under makeup during the day. It soaks in super fast and doesn't feel greasy, but lasts for hours. Definitely helped reduce puffiness. Maybe a bit on the dark circles, too.  Second choice. I'd buy this one again! Contains: eyeliss and haloxyl.

The scent is a little too strong, but still pleasant and floral. Left my skin feeling very smooth, and very moisturized at first, but didn't last long enough. One pump gel goes a very long way, so I ended up smearing most of it on my face. Not intense enough for my dry, baggy under-eye skin. I used the rest of it up as a face lotion, which I really liked for face lotion, but not for over a dollar per pump.

I have dropped BD's from much higher and on tile and it still held up. Unfortunately the dryer was a gift and I didn't have a receipt or I would have contacted the company and explained the situation.

By now you know that I am not only a licensed Hair stylist and Makeup Artist to some of the biggest names, but I am one of the most trusted on product knowledge.

As I researched this product and its ingredients a little deeper, I discovered that it is only a subtle, temporary fix for giving a little smoothing effect to the hair. There is no long term benefits from using this product. Don't waste your money. Yes, it smells nice, but it's not what it claims to be. No, I'm not hating on Moroccan Oil. There is nothing wrong with using it if you are just looking for a subtle and temporary fix and don't mind spending the money. You could get better results with pure organic coconut oil (used in small amounts). Now that I've told you the truth about this product, I will be honest and say I love their hairsprays and glimmer shine spray. You'll have to read those reviews there. If you want an alternative to this oil, Orofluido is much better, smells better and has more lasting results. Be sure to read my reviews before purchasing any hair product.

It does nothing for my lashes, but it's better than nothing if it's raining out or I know I might cry.\n\nI first tried this LaRoche-Posay before I took a shower. I didn't bother to curl my lashes. HOLY COW! It went on like a dream, and the more I applied, the bigger and more dramatic my lashes got. It even curled them (although not as dramatically as an eyelash curler). And they were smooth and silky looking, not clumpy or with bits hanging here and there. I then took a shower, making sure the water got right in my face. I was so shocked to see that my lashes looked exactly the same afterwards! Other waterproof mascaras I've tried didn't run when wet, but my lashes would uncurl, look mangled and \"chunky.\"  This mascara left them perfect.\n\nI did have a hard time removing it, however. I can only use non-oily removers due to my acne-prone skin, so I'm sure that's why. But I had to bring out the big guns and do a lot of scrubbing.\n\nI tried the mascara for real the next day.  I experienced a slight irritation (burning) in my eyeballs after a number of hours. Sometimes when that happens, if I use a product a few more times, the burning stops.

Does the product work? Yes. Is it any more effective than other products which espouse anti-aging through hyaluronic acid? No. On top of that, it does not even seem to moisturize especially well. As someone who has used hyaluronic acid serum for years, I really was expecting this formulation to be an improvement over other products, ESPECIALLY at this price point. It totally was not. In fact, I've found that I prefer the common hyaluronc acid serums you can find everywhere these days. They are:\n\n1) Much cheaper and easier to find\n2) Cosmetically elegant / apply well with other products\n3) Can be DIY'ed\n\nI notice a lot of people who have started using this at the recommendation of their dermatologist or surgeon. Hyaluronic acid (sodium hyaluronate) is amazing because it is a hydrophilic (water-loving) molecule that binds H2O and is naturally present in skin and other soft tissues. It lubricates joints, eyes, and can hold 1000 times it's own weight in H2O. Skin that is abundant in hyaluronic acid is better able to hold moisture and look plump - and diminish wrinkles. If you have never used hyaluronic acid aside from this product, and you'd prefer not to spend $100 for 2oz, TRY a generic hyaluronic acid serum first. I personally love My Beauty Diary Hyaluronic sheet masks, but I'd recommend the Timeless Skincare 4oz bottle of hyaluronic acid for anyone that prefers not to look like Hannibal Lecter when they get in bed, or for layering in the morning.\n\nIf you're looking for a great moisturizer with amazing hydration, look at SkinMedica's Dermal Repair Cream.

I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?! I still think that the payoff is pretty great and that my shadows look great and don't crease.

Not only is workmanship sloppy, it is not the standard of profession warranted by Babyliss Pro. (picture uploaded to Amazon)\n\nI shared one with my roommate back in university for a couple of years. The texture of a legit Babyliss straightener glides on hair smoothly, leaves hair soft and smooth, heats up instantly, and you see results within minutes. My roommate has it for 5 years now and it is working in top-notch condition as the day she received it.\n\nThe one I received DID not do any of the above. It straightens but it is comparable to a cheap straightener from a drug store. My hair is left somewhat straight and rough. The straightener is VERY light and feels all plastic! (Granted, Babyliss straighteners are light but it doesn't feel cheap) The power cord is also loose (i.e, in the future it is very likely to not transmit not enough power to the straightener)\n\nAnyway, I am not gonna leave the seller's name bc Idk if they know of it or not...so please, inspect yours upon arrival.

You apply it to your clean  face and neck avoiding the eye area.  It dries in 5 to 10 minutes.  You then remove it using warm water.\n\n\"I tried this product before my morning shower.  It went on much smoother than the masks I am accustomed to using.  It felt creamier and got into difficult areas around nose and creases in neck.  Drying time really depends on oil content of your skin.  It actually took about 12 minutes to totally dry on my face, especially around my nose where I have high oil concentration.  It came off quite smoothly in the shower and did not get stuck in hairy areas of my mustache, eyebrows, and hair line.  It did provide me with an invigorating tingling feeling that I enjoy and seemed to remove blackheads well.\n\n\"The only thing prohibitive of regular usage would be the cost.  My normal facial mask product is Queen Helene Mudd Pack or Mint Julep which sells for $4 for 8 ounces.

I finally decided that I must need to dry it with a towel and that it would probably feel clean.  But it still felt greasy after drying with a towel.  I used my favorite toner and decided not to use any night cream because my face still felt greasy.

I have found that round brushing when doing a blow out doesn't work for my very long curly hair. I much prefer to use the straightening pik or comb attachment with a hair dryer and then flat iron. There are not very many hair dryers like that on the market except ones specifically geared towards my demographic (if you know what I mean). So, this hair dryer fit the bill. When I received the package I initially tested it out and the first thing I noticed was the awesome comb attachment. It is made of durable plastic and the pik's teeth are thick and seem to be well constructed. I don't think you'll have a problem with comb breaking at all. Now as for the hair dryer itself, it is a fail. The hair dryer is a very pretty red color and is relatively quiet but its very awkward to hold in your hands for a long period of time. It felt like my hands were sliding off of the handle, not to mention the control buttons are right on the area where you would hold the dryer - definitely annoying. The hair dryer also doesn't seem to get very hot. I need major heat and this was just so-so. I had an Andis dryer before and while my Andis is only 1875 watts it seemed to get my hair much more straighter.

I started doing very gentle highlighting (hair painted on with different colors of blonde) on my light brown hair and it look amazing!  After about a year of coloring...(ie every 4 months the highlights were touched up and a haircut) this small amount of coloring and the onset of winter left my hair breaking and lots of knotted ends. It had only been 3 weeks since my last haircut/haircolor. The only heat treatment I ever used was gentle drying on my bangs to blow them out, but it didn't take much to damage my hair.  I tried a wash-in keratin treatment (Aphogee), I tried deep conditioning treatments (one was Aussie...but I tried many others).  None smoothed out my hair more than a day or so...and the dried ends just returned.  I then did a glaze treamtent (Sebastian cellophane Clear), which smoothed things out and helped seal the cuticle for the time being.  The next week, however, I got flustered with the damage.....and my wedding is later this year...so the damage really scared me.  I binged on a couple seasons of a Netflix show and I cut off just the tips of a lot of my ends myself (which is usually ok), however, I did it so much until my layers were gone...so I messaged my stylist...apologized for being crazy and taking shears to my head, and he fit me in to fix the damage. We wanted to keep the length to prepare for my wedding, so again, he just trimmed the ends up, however the hair itself was still dry. He recommended the Oribe Hair Masque for me to use once a week, and said if it wasn't a strong enough conditioner for my hair the company would buy back the remainder of the container from him and I could exchange for a stronger conditioner.  I used this one time and my hair was beautiful. I washed with clarifying shampoo (Kendra) and then my coloring shampoo (redken) and then towel dried,applied the masque for 5 minutes, and washed out.  I applied just a small amount of head after washing out just to seal in any remaining conditioner...it has been 4 days and my hair is still amazing.  Awesome product.  I recommend for those who have mild heat and/or color damage to use once a week,"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-57441", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "OMG!

I'm a big fan of Reuzel and I use several of their products everyday.  The Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm) are the first Reuzel products I have ever been disappointed with.\n\nThe directions on the label instruct to apply this product to a clean, towel dried beard (I normally use beard oil in this manner). The problem is that this product contains no natural oils, only a bunch of unnecessary chemicals. The only up side is that it also contains Reuzel's T-4 Tonic Blend which is beneficial. But your beard needs more than just that. It needs natural oils and conditioners, not all the chemicals.  I prefer the results I get with all natural products.  My beard is softer, healthier and more manageable when using my regular products.\n\nMy regular routine consists of a quality beard oil right out of the shower, massaging it into the skin and brushing it through the hair with a boar bristle brush. I let the oil absorb while I tend to other things.  A few minutes later I apply a beard balm that contains Shea Butter, Mango Seed Butter, Lanolin, Apricot Kernel Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Beeswax, and Cocoa Seed Butter. Then at the end I apply a little beard wax to provide the hold. This gives me a soft, healthy, manageable beard without any chemicals and no long term hair damage. The results of my routine are far superior to the Reuzel Beard Foam & Beard Balm combo.\n\nOkay, the scent...  I know full well that smells are subjective, but... this Beard Foam STINKS!!  At first it smells like soap, --so far so good-- BUT then it goes through a bad breath stage, which progresses into to a plastic/rubbery smell, then it finally settles into a powdery scent, similar to the Beard Balm.  This powdery scent then lingers on, and on, and on, and on...  I personally HATE  powdery smells, so if you're like me avoid the Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm, it's even worse).  However, if you're one of those weirdos that actually wants to smell like a big 'ol powder puff, well... you're going to love it.\n\nSpeaking to the 'deodorizing' properties, I suppose if you just finished eating your girlfriend's second-hand tuna sandwich the Beard Foam may provide a slight improvement to your beard's smell.

This product has a lot of steps to it and I do NOT reccmoned it if you do nit have any experience with hair. I have been dying cutting and styinging my own hair for about 4 years now so I was ok doing this on my own. I reccommend using you tube for a few tutorials before applying, and throughly read the instructions before starting! I purchased the iFixx and I protect cream as well since my hair has undergine many chemical process' (Dying counts)\nDO NOT use this after you have recently dyed your hair!!!!! It stripped alot of the red out of my hair after i used cream #1, also do not leave it on for a long time if you dye you hair frequently as IT WILL damage your hair. I left cream #1 on about 20 min after I completed the application (try to apply it very quckly starting with the area of your hair that is most course/curly, for me that was the back of my head). DO not put it on the ends of your hair until you are at that last 5 min of process time!!!!\n This product tells you to blow dry your hair and then straighten it before applying cream #2, now I hate using a blow dryer so I let it haor dry for a while before I used the blow dryer and I don't feel like it affect the quality of my results. I blow dried the rest when it was about 75% dry and then straightened it. You don't need the boi Ionic straightener for this but I do recommend using a good straightener. I have the CHI and it worked very well.\nCream #2 is the same but I let it process for about 7 min after I complete the application. After I washed it out I made sure I did not use any shampoo and I did not straigten it afterwards. I let it air dry so I could get an accurate idea of how well it worked, and I was pleasantly surpirsed. my hair was straight, it had some minor waves but it was mor managable. I put a litle more of the iprotect oil in as it was drying as it wasa little dry and frizzy but I blame that on the excessive amout of washing and chemicals applied to it. I also threw in some high quality Argan oil to add moisture back in, I will need to re-dye my hair in a few days since its kind of orange now but all in all its pretty good stuff. plus I did not need to use all of the product so I have enough to retouch it at least twice!"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-78009", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "The only curling iron that has ever worked on my heavy straight hair."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-13087", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Might help to know the age of the people who notice a difference and the ones that don't."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-38435", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I did not love the scent and it was a bit too greasy for my combination skin.

I'm a big fan of Reuzel and I use several of their products everyday.  The Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm) are the first Reuzel products I have ever been disappointed with.\n\nThe directions on the label instruct to apply this product to a clean, towel dried beard (I normally use beard oil in this manner). The problem is that this product contains no natural oils, only a bunch of unnecessary chemicals. The only up side is that it also contains Reuzel's T-4 Tonic Blend which is beneficial. But your beard needs more than just that. It needs natural oils and conditioners, not all the chemicals.  I prefer the results I get with all natural products.  My beard is softer, healthier and more manageable when using my regular products.\n\nMy regular routine consists of a quality beard oil right out of the shower, massaging it into the skin and brushing it through the hair with a boar bristle brush. I let the oil absorb while I tend to other things.  A few minutes later I apply a beard balm that contains Shea Butter, Mango Seed Butter, Lanolin, Apricot Kernel Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Beeswax, and Cocoa Seed Butter. Then at the end I apply a little beard wax to provide the hold. This gives me a soft, healthy, manageable beard without any chemicals and no long term hair damage. The results of my routine are far superior to the Reuzel Beard Foam & Beard Balm combo.\n\nOkay, the scent...  I know full well that smells are subjective, but... this Beard Foam STINKS!!  At first it smells like soap, --so far so good-- BUT then it goes through a bad breath stage, which progresses into to a plastic/rubbery smell, then it finally settles into a powdery scent, similar to the Beard Balm.  This powdery scent then lingers on, and on, and on, and on...  I personally HATE  powdery smells, so if you're like me avoid the Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm, it's even worse).  However, if you're one of those weirdos that actually wants to smell like a big 'ol powder puff, well... you're going to love it.\n\nSpeaking to the 'deodorizing' properties, I suppose if you just finished eating your girlfriend's second-hand tuna sandwich the Beard Foam may provide a slight improvement to your beard's smell.

For the most part, it still keeps my skin clean and acne free. :) The only con that I will mention is that this new formula makes the skin around my mouth noticeably dry and flaky :("}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-58494", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Love this product but it made breakout each time I wore it, so I can't use it.\n\nIt had a great look on the skin and decent coverage for a tinted moisterizer."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-33081", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "The saying \"you have to use it for it to work\" is completely true with this product.

I'll put it on when I wake up and go to work and notice it's still sitting on top of my skin at lunch time. It's hard to not rub my eyes.\n2.

I took a picture of my eye before to make sure I wasn't missing anything.\n4. It did not soften, brighten or remove any puffiness.\n\nThe cream is in a nice dispenser and a little goes a long, long way. It glides on nice and I would love to give this stuff 5 stars.

Every once in a while I would get a smooth application, and I didn't want to waste it so I tried to just use a little bit mixed with a lipstick. It helped sometimes, but I can only be so patient. After trying for over a month I gave up and threw it away. I bought two more from their regular website and they're perfect. Never buying from their Amazon store again.\n\nOriginal Review: I got a sample when I was subscribed to Birchbox and loved it! I needed a clear lip product to apply before going to bed because I like the feeling of moisturized lips in the morning. I didn't really expect anything from this little tube, but I was blown away. The gloss isn't sticky or shimmery, it's just enough to hydrate your lips. I wear it in the morning, and again at night time, and I haven't had to exfoliate my lips since I started using this product. My lips feel plump and smooth all day long. My lipsticks have never looked better! It's the only lip product I have actually fully used up, this being my third tube.

If I had unlimited income I would still be using the cleansing line, and may again.  Love the smell and feel of my skin - even before lotion.  However, Cetaphil still gives me non-drying non-irritating cleansing that it has for 30 years and it's alot more economical, beside I always use some type of lotion after cleansing.  The strengthener is 5% pro-niacin and lighter than the intensive or eye cream. I tried putting my daily facial sunscreen over the strengthener but too much lotion.  That is why I added the sunscreen when daily sunscreen became necessary in March.  The sunscreen is only 2.5% pro-niacin but priced accordingly.  It was better than eliminating the pro-niacin or sunscreen.  I also tried the decolletage lotion at 2.5% pro-niacin for spots on chest and hands but did not see results.

After the very first use I saw a reduction in the amount of hair that returned on my arms and legs. It actually performed better than I had dared to hope for on that 1st treatment of m arms and legs.  I have a few hairs on my face that I had hoped it would get rid of, but after 4 treatments I can't tell any difference in my facial hair, but it is already sparse and fairly fine.  The hair coming back on my arms and legs is more sparse and doesn't come back very quickly.  A week after treatment I had to look carefully at my legs to see if I thought I needed to shave.  I decided that I did, but it was not as thick and only as long as it usually is after about 2 or 3 days.  I do have fair skin and medium brown hair so it is a good combination for optimal results I guess.  I haven't seen any real noticeable improvements with the subsequent treatments (2-4), but after a treatment it looks pretty good for a week afterward, so it remains slower coming back than shaving.  I am happy with my purchase so far.\nI am disappointed with t he life of the lamp cartridges.  It advertised that there were 7000-10,000 flashes per cartridge.  By my estimation there are probably between 2000-3000 flashes.  I figured this after counting the number of flashes in a few sample areas and multiplying those by the numbers of areas that  were similar.  It should be a fairly accurate estimate. I was able to treat my face armpits, top of my forearms and legs all once and my face armpits and one forearm on the 2nd treatment with a cartridge.  When one cartridge \"burned out\" after just that much use I began the 2nd cartridge and counted flashes in sample areas, to see if maybe it really was using 7000-10,000 flashes to cover by body, but it really wasn't and the 2nd cartridge \"burned out\" before I finished a 3rd treatment.  Luckily I had ordered a replacement after the 1st one burned out and it was here to finished my 3rd treatment and do a 4th treatment.  Anyway it wasn't just one \"poor\" cartridge.  It appears that they really only do have about 1/3 of the advertised life.

It works really well just like the CHI I used to own.  It heats up really quick and does the job well.  The only problem I have with it is the on/off button and heat adjustment knob looks cheaply made.  It's more of an appearance thing, my CHI looked top to bottom like a product made with great material.  This one just appears to have more of a cheap plastic look to it, but just the button/knob part, the rest of it looks really good.  I guess I was just surprised, but for the price it does just as good as those expensive CHI straighteners.  If I had been able to afford a more expensive straightener by Babyliss I would hope the buttons don't look like cheap plastic.  Otherwise, 5 stars still because it works great!  Babyliss makes awesome straighteners, even the cheaper ones such as this one works nicely.\n\nUPDATE***\nJust a couple days after writing this review my straightener stopped working.  I have only had this straightener for 24 days before it broke.  I didn't drop it or expose it to water, suddenly one morning it just didn't heat up.  It turns on, but the plates don't get even remotely warm.  It showed no signs of failure prior, in fact I used it the day before and it was great.  I just wish it would not have broken, and it still deserves 4 stars because it worked well when it was working.  I noticed there was something inside the straightener that seemed loose, when I shook it a bit it sounded like a piece of plastic had broken off or something inside.  Maybe something did fall apart inside and that's why it broke, I feel this straightener could have been made with better material.  As I mentioned previously, the buttons and knob had a cheap plastic look to it, I was going to get an exchange but turns out fulfillment by Amazon is refund only.  So I suppose I'm taking my refund and spending it on another straightener instead.

Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years.

It's one of the things I admire and pride myself about my body. One day during finals week (I'm guessing excessive stress made this happen) but I got a pimple. It hurt so bad and was huge. When I do (rarely) get a pimple, you can barely see them because I treat them before and during its early emergence on my face. Somehow, I came across (Please don't publicly shame me when I say this) an Instagram post on Yahoo of a Kylie Jenner snapchat of how she treats her face for acne. Due to that snapchat and my desperation, I forked over $16 on this drying lotion. Why did I do that? This stuff just chemically burns the crap out of my face, left the area peeling, and left behind a dark case of hyper-pigmentation. My skin isn't even that sensitive. Never again will I buy something like this to put on my face. I'll stick to the basics that have always worked for me.\n\nHere's what works for me if you're curious: I get almost all of this stuff on amazon\n-A gentle cleanser (cetaphil or neutrogena)\n-Oil cleansing every now and then (olive oil and castor oil with a few drops of Trader Joe's tea tree oil are my faves)\n-ACV mixed with water as a toner or Burt's Bees tomato toner\n-Tea tree oil and clean and clear's persa-gel ( to treat bumps and pimples )\n**I've learned that if you really want to have nice skin, you have to protect it and keep it moisturized. Also keep your routine SIMPLE**\n-Olay Total effects 7 in one SPF 30 or Olay Complete for Combination/Oily skin SPF 15 in the am (depends on the season)\n-Olay Regenerist Night Cream in the pm or SR Luna Oil with SR Good Genes serum\n\n(The only non-drug store things I use on my face are Sunday Riley's Luna Oil and Good Genes serum. They're pretty darn good!!! The Luna Oil also has certain antiseptic properties that help prevent acne! Crazy right?! It also makes my skin so soft! The serum is good for hyper-pigmentation and brightening skin. Both of them do many other things too! Sephora has a duo kit for $78. It was a birthday gift to myself! I work on campus! Don't judge! As a college student, I often times don't get as much sleep that I'm suppose to and I was afraid that it would start showing in my face even though the saying is \"Black don't crack\". I got this duo to help prevent premature aging. #wrinkles #bags #Crowsfeet #SayNoToFillers #SayNoToBotox #AgeGraciously)\n\n***Side Note: I use to have really bad oily skin. In early high school, I would dry it out with acne astringents and skip out on moisturizer at night because I didn't want my face to be really oily. Eventually, I realized that my face was overproducing oils because of this behavior. The moment I started using gentle cleansers, oils, and moisturizers, the moment my skin realized it didn't need to drown itself in sebum. As I go through my day, I still do produce oil on my skin but it's not excessive. It's just a healthy amount to protect my face from the harsh environment and create a healthy glow. During the warmer months, I walk around with a pack of oil blotting sheets just in case.\n\nI hope this helped someone! I know it was a lot to read. Also, use smile.amazon.com to make your purchases!

Will be throwing out and getting something different.\n\nFirst, and perhaps not so important, this straighter does have a sleek look. It's lightweight and narrow, unlike some of the bulky straighteners I've owned in the past. This is a plus as it takes up less counter space and isn't an eyesore.\n\nThere is one button that controls on/off and the temperature of the device. Holding down the button turns it on/off, while double clicking allows for temperature control. Above the button there is a series of lights that change depending on the temperature and indicate that the straighter is heating vs ready to use. While, as far as I can tell, this type of control set-up does work, the different temperatures are not noted on the device. I use the same temp every time, so this doesn't affect me as much, but, if you might need to adjust the heat, you'll have to check the instructions pamphlet for temp ranges.\n\nI have admittedly thin hair, but it is naturally curly. I had no problem straightening the majority with only one pass, but some of the more finicky bits, like my bedhead bangs, took a bit more finesse.\n\nAs a plus, this straightener did come with two hair clips to divide and twist up hair when straightening.

I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?!

I was unimpressed with it at first because I'm so used to traditional curlers. I probably only tried ACTUALLY using this thing about two times before my original review. What changed my mind? I misplaced the curler I was using (again) and the Japonesque Curler was all I had available. Being determined to curl these lashes, I pulled it out and gave it a shot. TO MY SURPRISE, my eyelashes curled like I've NEVER seen them curl before! Yes, this item is \"plastic-ie\", but if used correctly, it works wonders!! I will never buy another curler again! I'm hooked! Seriously, my lashes curl so well that I only put eye-liner on my top lid and I'm good to go. No more mascara!!!\n\nMy original review:\n\n\"I'm a little disappointed in this little curler. I lost my favorite eyelash curler a couple weeks ago and have had my eyes on this one for some time now (no pun intended). I finally made the purchase. While I -impatiently- waited for this to come in the mail (didn't take long, but I needed something), I bought a cheapy $2 eyelash curler from a local store...to my surprise, the $3 curler works much better than this Japonesque Curler. I used a different curler on each eye to compare the two and unfortunately, this curler didn't curl my lashes nearly as well. With the money I spent on this one, I could've bought 3 of my \"cheapy\" one.\""}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-5870", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "HEAVY scent of rose.

(Though that isn't always good when I am trying to hide a purchase!) I couldn't wait to use this dryer so I washed and conditioned my hair the evening it arrived.\n\nI will start off telling you the one reason I didn't give this 4 stars.  Others have mentioned the weight and I will agree that so far this is the heaviest dryer I have ever used.  I am getting better with it the more I use it and that is not enough of an issue that I still don't love it -- but I would imagine my Mom wouldn't like it since she has had carpel tunnel issues in the past.  I hit my head with this dryer the 1st time I used it because I wasn't used to the weight.  Though I am not known for my grace either.\n\nI like to style my hair with only a hairdryer but since I had a mishap with some home hi-lighting, my hair is pretty damaged so it is too frizzy after blow drying because of its current condition that I have had to also use a big curling iron or flat iron to smooth it out.  No More.  I dry it all over which I swear now takes me about 3 minutes - this thing is strong - then I attached the nozzle to smooth and slightly curl my hair under.  Amazing.  My hair is smooth and shiny.  I honestly didn't believe that I would be able to style my hair so quickly and have it look so good.  The first time I used it I had so much volume that it was almost comical.  My hair was a bit too big.  I was used to styling my hair with a lesser dryer and I could tell after one use with this dryer.\n\nA few mentioned the buttons.  I had no issues with them.  I always look at my dryer to see what the heat, speed etc is before using it so it didn't matter to me like others mentioned that you couldn't change your setting without looking.  It's something that doesn't slow me down or matter.  I used it only on high heat with both settings.  I use the lower speed with the nozzle for more precise styling and high heat, high speed for all over drying.  I have never been one to bother with the other settings.\n\nThe price for this hairdryer is great.  I've bought drug store hairdryers that cost $40 to $50 and there is no comparison.  I think it is even a little cheaper now than when I ordered it.  I'm tempted to order a backup.

I bought this curling iron for my wife, after reading online reviews.  She LOVED this curling iron.  She liked that it heated up fast, opened and closed well, gripped her hair when she wanted it to, and let go when it was supposed to.\n\nI couldn't say exactly when it went from \"love\" to less than that.  But it started probably around the two year mark, after being used on average, about once per week.  It started to not heat up really well, and I think that there had been a flaw of some kind in the power cord, at the point where the cord attaches to the swivel connection on the iron.  There was no visible problem, anywhere on the cord.  It eventually got to the point where it didn't heat at all.  That was probably in this last year, so it was a good 2-3 years old, I would say.\n\nSo this last winter, about 2/2014, I took the thing apart, and couldn't find a thing wrong.  I put it back together and kind of told my wife that it was her imagination--I don't know, I think I was just too busy at the time to be bothered.  Then when I saw her a few weeks later using another old curling iron, and I asked her why she wasn't using the her favorite, and she said it just doesn't work anymore.  So I figured maybe she wasn't making it up :)\n\nI took it apart again, and put an ohm meter on the cord part, and it was not good.  I figured it unlikely that it was in the actual cord.  So I started to cut into the thick part of the cord where it had a reinforced curve in it, and was able to get down to where I found that there must have been a break there.  I cut that part of the cord out, soldered the cord onto the connectors that had been inside that molded reinforced curve, and put all of it back together with epoxy as something of a new homemade connection to reinforce it, and she was off and running again.\n\nThen in just the last few months, probably when the curling iron was about 3 1/2 years old, my wife started complaining that the curling iron was not gripping her hair well enough, and was slipping, and also that it was making a squeaking sound whenever she opened and closed the pincers--don't know if that's the right term.  I am also not sure I understand another comment that she made, though, that she has trouble getting her hair out of it when she finds it is slipping.\n\nAnyway, all of that doesn't matter.  I just looked at the spring area and could see that up underneath where the spring is, the point that contacts the pincer just below the thumb knob, there is a tiny roller that helps the spring to slide quietly back and forth, that was off center, and it also wasn't rolling anymore.  It was mostly sliding.  So I adjusted it to the side a little, and liberally sprayed some dry lubricant on it.  The action works better, and it doesn't make any noise, so we will have to wait until she uses it again to see if it works.\n\nSo as of today 6/16/2014, the iron is still going after approximately 200+ uses, albeit with some required tweaking to keep it out of the garbage.  I would like to believe that the power cord issue that we had was a rare defect, and that most people never run into that.  I'm thinking that most people could use this iron over 200 times and probably just be starting to have a squeaky spring issue, and that's about it.  If I were to have to start this product search again, I would definitely take a chance again on this iron, and hope that we didn't get the cord defect in that reinforced bend near the swivel.\n\nFor the money, and the use that we've had with this, I think it's a great deal.  I actually just realized that we probably have used it many more than 200 times, as we have four girls aged 12 and under as well, but they generally don't get their hair curled, although on some special occasions, several of them do.\n\nDetails on my star rating:\nWhy did I ding this by one star?  Well, although I would buy it again in a second, Amazon's star system equates four stars with a \"like it\" and five stars as a \"love it.\"  I could imagine some engineering tweaks to their design that would eliminate the issues we had.  Also, I saw the inside of it when I was working on it, and although the parts were adequate, I would be cheating a curling iron with better quality parts that deserved the five stars, if I were to give this one five.\n\nAs I've said in other reviews that I've written, to me, either four or five stars is a \"buy with confidence\" in my book.  I wouldn't buy anything again with 1-2 stars on my scale, and a middle-of-the-road three star review by me would be \"your mileage may vary\" and would be a 50/50 shot."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-49460", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Purchased 6/2010, reviewed 6/2014:\n\nWell, better late than never.

I cut that part of the cord out, soldered the cord onto the connectors that had been inside that molded reinforced curve, and put all of it back together with epoxy as something of a new homemade connection to reinforce it, and she was off and running again.\n\nThen in just the last few months, probably when the curling iron was about 3 1/2 years old, my wife started complaining that the curling iron was not gripping her hair well enough, and was slipping, and also that it was making a squeaking sound whenever she opened and closed the pincers--don't know if that's the right term.  I am also not sure I understand another comment that she made, though, that she has trouble getting her hair out of it when she finds it is slipping.\n\nAnyway, all of that doesn't matter.  I just looked at the spring area and could see that up underneath where the spring is, the point that contacts the pincer just below the thumb knob, there is a tiny roller that helps the spring to slide quietly back and forth, that was off center, and it also wasn't rolling anymore.  It was mostly sliding.  So I adjusted it to the side a little, and liberally sprayed some dry lubricant on it.  The action works better, and it doesn't make any noise, so we will have to wait until she uses it again to see if it works.\n\nSo as of today 6/16/2014, the iron is still going after approximately 200+ uses, albeit with some required tweaking to keep it out of the garbage.  I would like to believe that the power cord issue that we had was a rare defect, and that most people never run into that.  I'm thinking that most people could use this iron over 200 times and probably just be starting to have a squeaky spring issue, and that's about it.  If I were to have to start this product search again, I would definitely take a chance again on this iron, and hope that we didn't get the cord defect in that reinforced bend near the swivel.\n\nFor the money, and the use that we've had with this, I think it's a great deal.  I actually just realized that we probably have used it many more than 200 times, as we have four girls aged 12 and under as well, but they generally don't get their hair curled, although on some special occasions, several of them do.\n\nDetails on my star rating:\nWhy did I ding this by one star?  Well, although I would buy it again in a second, Amazon's star system equates four stars with a \"like it\" and five stars as a \"love it.\"  I could imagine some engineering tweaks to their design that would eliminate the issues we had.  Also, I saw the inside of it when I was working on it, and although the parts were adequate, I would be cheating a curling iron with better quality parts that deserved the five stars, if I were to give this one five.\n\nAs I've said in other reviews that I've written, to me, either four or five stars is a \"buy with confidence\" in my book.  I wouldn't buy anything again with 1-2 stars on my scale, and a middle-of-the-road three star review by me would be \"your mileage may vary\" and would be a 50/50 shot."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-40478", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Much better than any other psoriasis shampoo I have tried."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-30723", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "This make up goes on smoothly and coverage is good; it does what it claimed to do.

Even people who have cut my hair were SHOCKED at the amount of hair loss I really have when they shampoo my hair and see it as it really is!  I have found nothing beats Toppik for coverage ---one thing though---you must have AT LEAST thin wisps of hair for the Toppik to adhere to as it will NOT adhere to bald scalp.

The only thing was, lately I've been suspecting that it is not really non comedogenic (it doesn't promise that anyway) and is probably the only reason I still break out. (I noticed my skin gets bad any time I accidentally fall asleep in it.) So I decided to try to find a foundation that had all the same qualities (good natural color, stays on all day, stays matte, good coverage, not cakey) but won't clog my pores. This sounded like the closest thing. Even though it is triple the price, I figured it was worth it because since it has SPF 30, I could stop buying the expensive SPF 30 I usually put on under the Revlon since Revlon only contains an SPF 6. This foundation, besides promising to be non comedogenic, promises to stay put for 16 hours and stay matte. It did neither for me. I only tried it for two days because I wanted to be able to send it back if it wasn't working, but this is how it compared:\nColor: I'm in between super light and tan and sometimes use self tanners. So in Revlon I either use Sand Beige by itself or mix Sand Beige with a lighter color called Buff. Either way looks really good/natural on me and just depends how tan or non tan my body is. So with this one that only comes in a few colors, I bought the nude to try and figured if I liked it I would buy the lighter color opal and mix them when I need it to be lighter. Well, I didn't get that far, but the nude was a little too orange. I asked a friend and she thought it looked fine but I thought it looked too orange/tan to me. I also think it looked different in different lighting so sometimes looked worse than others.\n\nApplying: It definitely went on much lighter and thinner than Revlon Colorstay which was a plus and still covered everything: acne, scars, freckles, etc. And it dried very fast which I like. Sometimes the Revlon doesn't dry fast enough for me when I'm in a hurry to finish my routine. BUT even though it dried, it was shiny. When I powdered it, I may as well not have put any powder at all because it was still pretty shiny. Especially on my forehead and nose. But when I touched it, it was totally dry. So that was kind of weird. I never experienced anything like that before and that's not really a look I like. I've always liked matte looking skin but like my blush to be shimmery - only on my cheeks. When I powder the Revlon it becomes very matte.\n\nThroughout the day: I normally have an oily t zone and with the Revlon Colorstay, the oily t zone starts to come out after 4-5 hours and the rest of my face stays normal. I usually use Clean and Clear oil blotters which would take care of it for another several hours and not take the make up off at all. With the Vichy, I felt like my entire face was getting very oily after only an hour. It's a little hard to tell since it was shiny from the beginning but I definitely could feel a difference too. When I used the oil blotters, the make up actually came off in some spots onto the sheet. So it does not stay put as promised. By the end of my 9 hour work day my jawline was missing and forehead was spotty. (And it's supposed to last 16 hours.) That never happens with the Revlon Colorstay. The second day I tried powdering instead of oil blotting and it was still very spotty, maybe even worse.\n\nThe first day I put it on with nothing underneath. The second day I used a semi expensive mattifying primer on one side of my face and what I consider my very expensive mattifying sunscreen that I normally use, on the other side of my face, to see if it made a difference but it did not. Still super shiny and oily and did not stay entirely on for my 9 hour work day. I was very disappointed because I did go in with high hopes and not wanting to be a skeptic, but I didn't see a reason to test it for a 3rd day. I can't say whether or not it prevented break outs since I didn't use it long enough. I don't want to continue using Revlon Colorstay if it's going to continue to clog my pores so I'll still be searching for something that has all these qualities I need and have to use it in the meantime. Very disappointed.\n\nUpdate: I tried CoverGirl Ready Set Gorgeous foundation and so far I've been liking that one. It's oil free, non pore clogging. I've been using it for over a week and so far haven't had any new breakouts. I even slept in it once. Coverage is surprisingly pretty good, staying power is decent, comes in a wide variety of colors and was a lot more matte than Vichy. And best of all it was only $6.99 at Target. Revlon was still the best make up I've ever used in terms of staying power and staying matte but so far I like how the CoverGirl has many of the good qualities as well as not clogging my pores! And if you don't have acne, you don't need as much of it and won't end up going through the vicious cycle of pore clogging and covering! Highly recommend anyone who is acne prone & oily instead of Vichy."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-10458", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Soothing cream for my recent eye surgery."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-56298", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I started buying this about 3 years ago and love it so much the fragrance is unisex so less in my tub.\nI noticed about 2 years ago my husband started using it as well in the shower and he doesn't bulk at the price even a little because he loves it so much.

So only reviewing as a skin moisturizer and dang this stuff is awesome! Wish I could underline lol! Awesome because of the smell (I know I'm going to lose a few people here, but I actually like the kind of minty, citronella candle smell), it absorbs quickly and thoroughly, which is definitely something that is hard to find. Even some lotions that say they absorb with no greasy feeling don't cut it and this stuff does! It seems to be helping my eczema! It's almost cleared up my arms and has nearly completely cleared up my hands including some hard, scaly patches that almost look like psoriasis, though I've never been diagnosed with that skin condition. I've used it all over my body and so far my only (very mild) complaint is, it made the skin of my face & neck break out so I will stick to Clinique products on my face, but everywhere else get's a nice, soothing coating of PM Tea Tree Oil Moisturizer.

I should admit that I have a thick, coarse, fast-growing beard, and what I review here may not be applicable for men with beards that are not as thick, coarse, or fast-growing. Upon reading the reviews of the open-comb, #25C being a more aggressive razor due to the open comb, I decided to give it a try.\n\nI've tried every type of shaving in the 40+ years that I've been shaving, including wet shaving with disposable razors, multiple-blade cartridge razors, double-edged safety razors, shavettes, and straight razors; and I've tried a number of different electric razors. No method of shaving comes close to shaving with a straight razor, which I did for years, but I tired of the constant maintenance (stropping 50 to 60 times each morning, occasional honing, and annual sharpening by a professional service), and the cost. Insofar as the multiple-blade cartridge razors, the cost is prohibitive, and the supposed benefits of multiple blades is a gimmick, at least as far as my experience with them. Disposable razors are hit-and-miss in terms of quality. Even using a good quality double-edged razor, I still need to do a final touch-up with a shavette, unless I want 5 o'clock shadow by noon.\n\nSo, I thought that the 25C would provide a closer shave than the 33C, as posted by many reviewers.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nI could detect no discernable difference between the 25C and the 33C. Upon close inspection of the design, I am convinced that it is because the base plate on the 25C holds the blade much closer to the comb that does the base plate on the 33C. On the closed-comb 33C, there is about 1mm of space between the blade and the comb, which allows for more direct contact with the skin by the blade, depending upon the angle at which one holds the razor. On the open-comb 25C, the blade is almost in direct contact with the combs, with no perceptible space between them. Consequently, it is not possible to get the same full contact with the skin as it is with the 33C.\n\nI did change the blades that I've been using, switching to the Feather Hi-stainless blades, which appear to be much sharper than the Astra blades or the Personna blades that I had been using. Still, even with the Feather blades, the shave is not close enough, and I have to do a final pass against the grain with a straight-razor or a shavette. The feather blades last for about 3 shaves before I have to replace them.\n\nBoth the 25C and the 33C are fine DE razors, and I would buy them again. However, I will be more cautious in reading reviews of razors claiming to be \"more aggressive.\""}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-20303", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Needs to be a little darker."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-22657", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "l wanted to use this product because of its good reviews.  so I ordered it from the nuface website and used it once.

So if you have hair growth due to aging, PCOS, or some other similar factor then this is for you. If you have lots of hair because of heredity/ethnicity, this may not work for you and may account for some of the bad reviews of this product.\n\nHere's my take. I have been battling an ever worsening crop of thick, black chin hairs and a dense mustache (thankfully light colored) for several years now. I don't have full blown PCOS, but I have similar symptoms and definite hormonal issues. I can't afford laser and I bought one of those IPL things for home use, but have been scared to use it. I've plucked and shaved for years now and that hair grows back FAST. Crazy fast. Even plucked hairs are back in a couple of days. That's why I don't wax: I would have to do it once a week. I've wanted to buy this cream for a long time but, expecting disappointment, waited months to shell out the cash for it. I did a patch test with the cream and waited a few days because I have very sensitive skin. I had no reaction, so I shaved my chin and started rubbing the Gorilla Warfare in twice a day. ~It worked immediately~ The hair has stopped growing. I'm not exaggerating and I'm not a paid spokesperson... in ONE week, my rampant & disgusting beard (let's call it what it is) has stopped growing! The one, tiny little thing that sucks about it is that I should have WAXED before starting to use this cream because now I have visible black dots in a few spots that aren't growing out for me to pluck! I'm going to stop using the cream and wait for the hair to grow out. Then I will wax and start over with smooth, fresh skin.\n\nThe bottom line: Yes, it is expensive and, yes, you have to continue using it to maintain results (a little goes a long way, though!). If your hair problem is hormonal then this might work for you like it did for me and that makes the cream worth so much more than what I paid for it.\n\nUpdate: It is ten days later and only now my hair has grown back to the point that I made a waxing appointment. It took probably 5 days to start seeing significant regrowth after only a couple of applications. That makes me think that, for some people, you can get away with using this less often to save money and still get some good results. I'll update in a couple of weeks to let you know how things work out post-wax."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-54278", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Works good, but not sure it is the best.

As some one who has had melanoma, skin protection from UVA/UVB is very important to me - more important than anti-aging. However, I figured since this product has both I would see how I liked it. I don't. First some things that I did like:\n\nPros:\n- (so far) has not caused a reaction to my skin, which other sun screen/sun block lotions can sometimes do\n- the tint - on me, anyway - seems to blend in okay with my skin coloring. Not too light, not too dark, not too \"orange.\"\n- this does make the imperfections in my skin seem much less noticeable, and provides a smooth skin tone\n- it promises a SPF 50, which is probably more than adequate for facial protection\n- it has a matte finish, no \"shininess.\"\n\nCons:\n- this product is the consistency of toothpaste. As recommended, I tried rubbing it in my hands to \"soften,\" but that did not work and it was an enormous bother.\n- because of the consistency of the product, putting it on my skin was not easy. I had to really rub it in to get it to absorb and blend - and pulling / tugging on delicate facial skin certainly doesn't aid in the aging process.\n- once it is on my skin I feel as though I have a mask on. While it doesn't feel heavy, exactly, it feels as though my skin has a layer over it.\n- this could possibly make a very good sun screen - except the instructions state it must be added every 2 hours. I can only imagine what this would feel like after several applications.\n- after putting this product on my face, it is very difficult to wash off my hands and fingers - even with hot water and soap.\n\nOverall, while this product may be very effective at blocking UVA/UVB, I simply do not like the way it makes my skin feel. I normally do not wear facial make-up - just moisturizer and sun screen - so having something that feels \"cake-y\" and like a mask feels too strange. Also, my face does feel as though it is moisturized, and that is important to me, being in my mid-50s. I could see this being a great product if I were on a hike or spending quite a bit of time in the sun. But, then the heavy, paste-like substance makes the prospect uninviting. I would be more inclined to wear a moisturizer with SPF 15 or 30 and to wear a hat.

I am considering other alternatives.\n\n--\n\nFYI - price estimate: If you are doing your arms in addition to the rest of your body (my arm hair is white so it would have no effect, as is the hair on my outer thighs) then I would guess one cartridge would give you one and a half passes for arms, underarms, legs and bikini.  You'd probably need 6 total to do your entire body the recommended number of times (I believe it's first four treatments 2 weeks apart, next three treatments 3-4 weeks apart, and then treatments as needed and only in specific areas, but it is all in the book you get with the kit), and then another 1-2 for any extra maintenance or trouble areas that may be causing trouble, so that gives you a better idea of pricing overall.\n\n--\n\nDay 1 - January 4: \"All I know is I got shot by a laser. Gosh darnit, my *censored* hurts. You're right about it being like a rubber band.\" -Boyfriend wanted to use it, too. He shot my legs, underarms, and bikini area. It actually melted any stubble so I believe it was working the right way. Make sure you shave the day before. He used the 5 the whole time on me, per my request, as I read a lot of reviews that said it only works at that level. It really did feel like a rubber band. Basically the softer tissue was when it hurt. I hardly felt it on my legs or stomach, mostly just my inner thighs. I also felt it around my knees while they were bent, but when I stretched out it was fine (book says don't laser skin that's not tight, so this is apparently why). We are thinking about the white eyeliner tip for round 2, as one of the issues was it was very hard to keep track of where we were. Thus far, it didn't seem to cause any irritation. Best part: the sound effects. Pew pew!\n\nDay 2 - January 20: Thus far, I've noticed I definitely had to shave in between.  My hair was still growing, and it was still coming in with no noticeable difference - to me.  However, not to be discouraged, we tried again!  Online articles said to expect only 10% of hair gone for any sort of laser hair removal.  During the process, my boyfriend used the singed bits of stubble as a sort of guide, and he also pressed down a bit harder as he went to leave a minor impression and keep track of where he had been.  We did my legs (only the inside of my thighs and then all of my lower legs) and under my arms, and then he also shot a few areas on his body.  He said that not a lot of hair has grown back from the areas he did.  One spot was a mole, but I did still notice a couple hairs.  He did one of my underarms twice on accident, so we'll compare the two and see if this is a positive strategy - that's for next time!  Keep you posted. (Also, the light is quite bright.  I hid my head under a blanket both this time and last, and my boyfriend was wearing sun glasses.  One of the other reviewers said they bought special glasses.  I don't think it's necessary for such a small procedure, but if you're doing multiple people or for some reason will need way more treatments or if you're actually doing your entire body, then at least wear sun glasses but please consider special glasses.  Come on, it's your eyes.)\n\nDay 3 - January 26: I don't really see a difference, but it's only the third treatment now. It may be my imagination, but some of the hair seemed thinner.  The instructions say to go every two weeks for the first few treatments, but my hair was starting to grow back and I had to shave Friday for the weekend, so we decided to have at it.  Hopefully my last $10 razor purchase!  My boyfriend said there was a noticeable difference between my two underarms, so I suppose it was a happy accident that we did one twice.  It meant a lot more overlap where the laser hit, which is where I think the real benefit was.  Because of this, he did both of my underarms twice today.  However, please note I DO NOT recommend doing this as it did leave minor burn marks after the second time, and the second time also hurt and felt burning - but come on, if you're zapping your skin on highest intensity TWICE then you better expect it!  However, it really just looks reddish, and it's just under my arms so no one sees it anyway.  A little lotion or aloe and it will be fine.  Also, I could smell the burning hair.  I definitely would NOT do my legs that way! We made it through one lower leg and then had to switch the laser cartridge to the second one. (Two per initial box.)  So, that means that one cartridge made it down both my legs twice (plus one more leg) and under my arms twice, and then did my bikini line twice and a couple spots on my boyfriend twice.  I have some BAD NEWS, though.  The little laser got really hot - which is part of the reason it burned me a bit more today and hurt more than it had before - and then it stopped working.  We were not misusing it, so I believe it was just a defective unit.  It's not a big deal since Amazon's return policy is solid.  I am going to send it back for a refund rather than a replacement because I don't know if it is really working or not.  However, if it is actually working, I will buy a new one and get back on it!  I'm going to give it two weeks and then reevaluate the status of my hair.  It sounds silly but I took a picture of my underarm today so I can actually compare.\n\nFinal update: After a series of three photos (the final a month after returning the device), I realized there was little to no hair loss.

It did blush my cheeks, but then it also turned up the sparkle too much for my liking.\n\nLooking at the ingredients, it starts with a few silicones at the top of the list.  So I would consider this to be a simple silicone primer.  Any color or skin perfecting you desire you will still have to accomplish via other methods, ex:  foundation of choice or mineral makeup of choice.\n\nI think I will have to save this for special events, or date nights.  This product could maybe add a nice touch for night-time makeup.  ( the sparkly touch might look nice in low lighting (restaurants, etc) or in pictures (as in: the pigments and sparkles will reflect the camera light and \"hide\" imperfections as far as the picture goes, but not in person).

He used the 5 the whole time on me, per my request, as I read a lot of reviews that said it only works at that level. It really did feel like a rubber band. Basically the softer tissue was when it hurt. I hardly felt it on my legs or stomach, mostly just my inner thighs. I also felt it around my knees while they were bent, but when I stretched out it was fine (book says don't laser skin that's not tight, so this is apparently why). We are thinking about the white eyeliner tip for round 2, as one of the issues was it was very hard to keep track of where we were. Thus far, it didn't seem to cause any irritation. Best part: the sound effects. Pew pew!\n\nDay 2 - January 20: Thus far, I've noticed I definitely had to shave in between.  My hair was still growing, and it was still coming in with no noticeable difference - to me.  However, not to be discouraged, we tried again!  Online articles said to expect only 10% of hair gone for any sort of laser hair removal.  During the process, my boyfriend used the singed bits of stubble as a sort of guide, and he also pressed down a bit harder as he went to leave a minor impression and keep track of where he had been.  We did my legs (only the inside of my thighs and then all of my lower legs) and under my arms, and then he also shot a few areas on his body.  He said that not a lot of hair has grown back from the areas he did.  One spot was a mole, but I did still notice a couple hairs.  He did one of my underarms twice on accident, so we'll compare the two and see if this is a positive strategy - that's for next time!  Keep you posted. (Also, the light is quite bright.  I hid my head under a blanket both this time and last, and my boyfriend was wearing sun glasses.  One of the other reviewers said they bought special glasses.  I don't think it's necessary for such a small procedure, but if you're doing multiple people or for some reason will need way more treatments or if you're actually doing your entire body, then at least wear sun glasses but please consider special glasses.  Come on, it's your eyes.)\n\nDay 3 - January 26: I don't really see a difference, but it's only the third treatment now. It may be my imagination, but some of the hair seemed thinner.  The instructions say to go every two weeks for the first few treatments, but my hair was starting to grow back and I had to shave Friday for the weekend, so we decided to have at it.  Hopefully my last $10 razor purchase!  My boyfriend said there was a noticeable difference between my two underarms, so I suppose it was a happy accident that we did one twice.  It meant a lot more overlap where the laser hit, which is where I think the real benefit was.  Because of this, he did both of my underarms twice today.  However, please note I DO NOT recommend doing this as it did leave minor burn marks after the second time, and the second time also hurt and felt burning - but come on, if you're zapping your skin on highest intensity TWICE then you better expect it!  However, it really just looks reddish, and it's just under my arms so no one sees it anyway.  A little lotion or aloe and it will be fine.  Also, I could smell the burning hair.  I definitely would NOT do my legs that way! We made it through one lower leg and then had to switch the laser cartridge to the second one. (Two per initial box.)  So, that means that one cartridge made it down both my legs twice (plus one more leg) and under my arms twice, and then did my bikini line twice and a couple spots on my boyfriend twice.  I have some BAD NEWS, though.  The little laser got really hot - which is part of the reason it burned me a bit more today and hurt more than it had before - and then it stopped working.  We were not misusing it, so I believe it was just a defective unit.  It's not a big deal since Amazon's return policy is solid.  I am going to send it back for a refund rather than a replacement because I don't know if it is really working or not.  However, if it is actually working, I will buy a new one and get back on it!  I'm going to give it two weeks and then reevaluate the status of my hair.  It sounds silly but I took a picture of my underarm today so I can actually compare.\n\nFinal update: After a series of three photos (the final a month after returning the device), I realized there was little to no hair loss.

As some one who has had melanoma, skin protection from UVA/UVB is very important to me - more important than anti-aging. However, I figured since this product has both I would see how I liked it. I don't. First some things that I did like:\n\nPros:\n- (so far) has not caused a reaction to my skin, which other sun screen/sun block lotions can sometimes do\n- the tint - on me, anyway - seems to blend in okay with my skin coloring. Not too light, not too dark, not too \"orange.\"\n- this does make the imperfections in my skin seem much less noticeable, and provides a smooth skin tone\n- it promises a SPF 50, which is probably more than adequate for facial protection\n- it has a matte finish, no \"shininess.\"\n\nCons:\n- this product is the consistency of toothpaste. As recommended, I tried rubbing it in my hands to \"soften,\" but that did not work and it was an enormous bother.\n- because of the consistency of the product, putting it on my skin was not easy. I had to really rub it in to get it to absorb and blend - and pulling / tugging on delicate facial skin certainly doesn't aid in the aging process.\n- once it is on my skin I feel as though I have a mask on. While it doesn't feel heavy, exactly, it feels as though my skin has a layer over it.\n- this could possibly make a very good sun screen - except the instructions state it must be added every 2 hours. I can only imagine what this would feel like after several applications.\n- after putting this product on my face, it is very difficult to wash off my hands and fingers - even with hot water and soap.\n\nOverall, while this product may be very effective at blocking UVA/UVB, I simply do not like the way it makes my skin feel. I normally do not wear facial make-up - just moisturizer and sun screen - so having something that feels \"cake-y\" and like a mask feels too strange. Also, my face does feel as though it is moisturized, and that is important to me, being in my mid-50s. I could see this being a great product if I were on a hike or spending quite a bit of time in the sun. But, then the heavy, paste-like substance makes the prospect uninviting. I would be more inclined to wear a moisturizer with SPF 15 or 30 and to wear a hat.

This is the exception of all exceptions. The smell is positively the most amazing, intoxicating scent I've ever smelled for a men's body product. Oh, and they didn't even have to put the irritant, \"fragrance\" in as an ingredient. Therefore, I now my head to you, Jack Black for creating such a tremendous scent without synthetic fragrant products. Also, it is sulfate free! You wouldn't know it by using it, as it lathers perfectly. One full pump is enough for your upper body.\n\nI never bought into the notion of a product being able to \"wake you up\" in the morning. Again, this is the absolute exception. Not only does the scent smell amazing and permeate throughout the shower, it truly does wake your senses up. I attribute that to the use of Menthol, Rosemary Essential Oil and Lavender Essential Oil -- two of the all around great multi-purpose oils.\n\nIf you are on the fence to shell out the amount of money required for such a premium body wash, don't think twice. It's that good. Oh, and it's sulfate free, fragrance free and paraben free! So, even the most sensitive skins can use it -- believe me, I have extremely sensitive skin. While those harsh preservatives are left out and it seems to be an \"all natural\" cleanser, there is one major drawback.\n\nIt also has hydrating features that are highlighted with the presences of both Shea Butter and Sunflower Seed Oil! So what's the catch?\nUnfortunately, I am a realist and have to be a critic of JB even though I love most of their products. That catch/drawback is the presence of Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate. Sounds relatively harmless right? Wrong. For starters, it comes BEFORE Shea Butter & Sunflower Oil, but that's not too big of a deal. The big deal is that it is a FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER!\n\nIt slowly releases formaldehyde into the product to kill any microbes to keep the product fresh and have the 6 month shelf life as advertised. Now, the actual formaldehyde is more than likely very, very trace amounts. But, since it's such a cult favorite, over a period of time, who knows? Formaldehyde is one of the few known carcinogens. Why take the chance when you already have Phenoxyethanol as a preservative?\n\nDear Jack Black, I highly doubt the formaldehyde releaser contributes to the greatness (smell and general usage) of the product, so why risk it? Please replace it with a more sensitive and/or natural preservative. Heck, you already have Phenoxyethanol in the product. Why not just use slightly more of that? There is tons of evidence to show that is a very mild preservative. Just a thought.\n\nOverall, though, I cannot resist the temptation of the premium price and Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate. I love, love, love it and will continue to use it with a hopefully substitute for the Sodium Hydroxy. Another gem from the Jack Black Turbo line.

But when I cross-referenced the writer's rave reviews with the real life reviews on Amazon.com and Makeup Alley, I chalked it up to another useless product I didn't need.\n\nFast forward two years.  I'm older, I have a newborn baby - my hair is a dry, frizzy mess.  I don't know if it is the hormones, age, lack of sleep, but my hair is so much dryer, and the texture has changed.  It's like the Vogue writer said, it's old lady hair, not young girl hair.  In the past, I would have doused it with deep conditioner and sat for 2 hours under my bonnet dryer (yes I have one of those).  But time is no longer  a luxury that I have and I'm not likely to see it again for the next ten years.  I need a solution that really works and doesn't take forever.\n\nThe Philip B. Katira hair masque is it.\n\nI think the term hair masque is a little confusing.  Hair masque conjures up images of intensive, creamy conditioner.  That is not what this product is.  It is a lightweight gel that fills in the porous cracks of damaged and dry hair, fortifying it, sealing it, softening it and making it oh so much better.  My hair is curly and after using the masque, I get well-defined, spiral curls all the way down my back.  And what's amazing is that the curls are really soft yet still well-defined.  In fact they are so soft and voluminous I put in either Ouidad hair spray or gel to stiffen it up.  It really does look like it did back in college when I could put $5 L'Oreal mousse in my hair, run out the door and have a fabulous hair day.  Ah youth!  Now it takes expensive haircuts and products to get it to look as good.\n\nThe Katira hair masque works best in conjunction with your favorite conditioners that you already have in your arsenal and makes them work better.  After I shower, I squeeze a good amount (I have a lot of long, curly hair) of the Philip B. hair masque into my hand and comb it through my hair with my fingers, followed with a wide tooth comb.  I have been experimenting with different kinds of comb-thru, leave-in conditioners all to great success including:  Weleda Rosemary hair oil (fabulous on my dry ends and a little goes such a long way), Devacurl One Condition,  Ouidad Summer Spray.  I don't use all of these leave-in's together - that would be too much!  But I choose one of these conditioners to use with the hair masque, depending on what my hair needs that day.  I do not wash any of this out.  To \"stiffen\" my curls, I have been spraying with Ouidad hair spray or using Kiehl's Silk Groom (I have had this bottle forever and never really used it, but it works really well in conjunction with the masque and maintains the volume in a nicely controlled way.)\n\nI bought other hair products before I purchased this one in my quest to soften my hair's dry texture:  Josie Maran Argan hair oil (I wanted to buy Moroccan hair oil treatment after I read Cindy Crawford's endorsement of it - she said it was good at softening the texture of older hair.  But they didn't have it at Sephora and Josie Maran is pretty much the same thing.  Alas, it is not as good as Philip B's solution.)  I also purchased Rene Furterer's deep conditioning masque.  Again good, but once it washed out, it never changed the inherent dry and wiry texture of my \"old lady\" hair.\n\nI also purchased the Philip B. Amber Shampoo (what a divine, yummy smell) and was given the Philip B. Peppermint and Avocado Shampoo for free after a shipping mix up.  Since the hair masque came first, I have used it alone as well as with the shampoos.  Unlike other hair products that need to be used with each other in order to work well, you really can use the hair masque alone to great success.  I shampooed my hair today with the Amber Shampoo and then used the Katira Masque, but there really wasn't a difference in terms of it working better with the shampoo.\n\nI will never be without the Philip B. masque again.  It really does work.

Lip exfoliation is one of the simplest, most inexpensive beauty routines one can engage in at home because it only requires two basic ingredients that virtually every household has on hand: sugar and oil.\n\nSpecifically, all that is required to exfoliate the lips is a tiny amount of granular sugar, either white table sugar (sucrose as in this product), brown sugar,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/raw-sugar/dp/B000EA3M4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">raw sugar</a>, or sugar alcohol such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/xylitol/dp/B001EO6852/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">xylitol</a>. Add to that an equal amount of any food-grade oil you have on hand in the house, for example: olive oil, canola oil, safflower oil, or coconut oil. One-fourth teaspoon each of granular sugar and oil is enough to do both lips.\n\nThe instructions for do-it-yourself exfoliation are as follows:\n\nIn a small bowl or saucer, measure out one-fourth teaspoon of granular sugar. On top of it put an equal amount of oil. Wash your hands and dry them thoroughly. Blend the sugar and oil together with the tip of your finger. Rub the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips in a circular motion for two-five minutes. Gently scrub off the mixture with a clean, damp washcloth to remove not only the sugar and oil, but any loosened, dead skin. If flaking, dead skin still remains on your lips, rub more of the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips and repeat the above process. After you are finished, immediately moisturize your lips, ideally with a natural, food-grade oil or a lip balm made with an oil-beeswax mixture, since anything that goes on the lips ultimately ends up in the mouth and stomach.\n\nThe second problem with this product is that even though the container looks small, there is enough of this product to last a very long time. And while it is sitting on your bathroom shelf, it is slowly drying out. Within six months to a year, long before you've used more than a fraction of it, this product will deteriorate into a hard, unusable lump (not to mention that most cosmetics companies recommend throwing out their products anyway within six to nine months because of inevitable bacteria buildup). If you make your own sugar-oil mixture each time you need it, nothing is wasted, and it is always fresh, with a smooth, viscous consistency that glides onto your lips.\n\nThe third problem with this product is that, though some of the ingredients are natural and food-grade, others are not. The ingredients for this product include: \"Sucrose, Petrolatum, Flavor, Caramel, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, VitiVinifera (Grape) Seed Oil.\" Below is a description of each ingredient. The most problematic one is petrolatum. It is too bad that the makers of this product didn't just stick to grapeseed oil, which is a natural, healthy oil.\n\nSucrose is simple white/table sugar.\n\nPetrolatum: This lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist Robert Chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called \"rod wax.\" This is a very thick substance which is anything but ideal for exfoliating the skin.\n\nFlavor: It is not specified whether this is \"artificial\" or \"natural\" flavor. Artificial flavor is derived from non-food substances, that is, chemicals created in a lab. Natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained. In both cases, there is no way to know how safe or healthy the flavoring is.\n\nCaramel: This is sugar or syrup heated until it turns brown. It can either be used as a coloring agent or to impart flavor.\n\nJojoba oil is a natural plant oil. It is created from the liquid wax of the seed of the jojoba plant, a shrub which is native to southern Arizona, southern California, and northwestern Mexico. It's much healthier than petrolatum, but it contains 14% erucic acid, which is not recommended to be taken internally.\n\nGrapeseed oil is a natural oil derived from the seeds of grape. It contains vitamin E and antioxidants."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-34809", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "buena excelente"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-67466", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I wish this had a light that said when the iron was heated up, instead a red light is constant.

Lip exfoliation is one of the simplest, most inexpensive beauty routines one can engage in at home because it only requires two basic ingredients that virtually every household has on hand: sugar and oil.\n\nSpecifically, all that is required to exfoliate the lips is a tiny amount of granular sugar, either white table sugar (sucrose as in this product), brown sugar,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/raw-sugar/dp/B000EA3M4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">raw sugar</a>, or sugar alcohol such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/xylitol/dp/B001EO6852/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">xylitol</a>. Add to that an equal amount of any food-grade oil you have on hand in the house, for example: olive oil, canola oil, safflower oil, or coconut oil. One-fourth teaspoon each of granular sugar and oil is enough to do both lips.\n\nThe instructions for do-it-yourself exfoliation are as follows:\n\nIn a small bowl or saucer, measure out one-fourth teaspoon of granular sugar. On top of it put an equal amount of oil. Wash your hands and dry them thoroughly. Blend the sugar and oil together with the tip of your finger. Rub the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips in a circular motion for two-five minutes. Gently scrub off the mixture with a clean, damp washcloth to remove not only the sugar and oil, but any loosened, dead skin. If flaking, dead skin still remains on your lips, rub more of the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips and repeat the above process. After you are finished, immediately moisturize your lips, ideally with a natural, food-grade oil or a lip balm made with an oil-beeswax mixture, since anything that goes on the lips ultimately ends up in the mouth and stomach.\n\nThe second problem with this product is that even though the container looks small, there is enough of this product to last a very long time. And while it is sitting on your bathroom shelf, it is slowly drying out. Within six months to a year, long before you've used more than a fraction of it, this product will deteriorate into a hard, unusable lump (not to mention that most cosmetics companies recommend throwing out their products anyway within six to nine months because of inevitable bacteria buildup). If you make your own sugar-oil mixture each time you need it, nothing is wasted, and it is always fresh, with a smooth, viscous consistency that glides onto your lips.\n\nThe third problem with this product is that, though some of the ingredients are natural and food-grade, others are not. The ingredients for this product include: \"Sucrose, Petrolatum, Flavor, Caramel, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, VitiVinifera (Grape) Seed Oil.\" Below is a description of each ingredient. The most problematic one is petrolatum. It is too bad that the makers of this product didn't just stick to grapeseed oil, which is a natural, healthy oil.\n\nSucrose is simple white/table sugar.\n\nPetrolatum: This lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist Robert Chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called \"rod wax.\" This is a very thick substance which is anything but ideal for exfoliating the skin.\n\nFlavor: It is not specified whether this is \"artificial\" or \"natural\" flavor. Artificial flavor is derived from non-food substances, that is, chemicals created in a lab. Natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained. In both cases, there is no way to know how safe or healthy the flavoring is.\n\nCaramel: This is sugar or syrup heated until it turns brown. It can either be used as a coloring agent or to impart flavor.\n\nJojoba oil is a natural plant oil. It is created from the liquid wax of the seed of the jojoba plant, a shrub which is native to southern Arizona, southern California, and northwestern Mexico. It's much healthier than petrolatum, but it contains 14% erucic acid, which is not recommended to be taken internally.\n\nGrapeseed oil is a natural oil derived from the seeds of grape. It contains vitamin E and antioxidants."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-4397", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "My only complaint is that the tube is very small.

The Mousse had no scent; this has a mild scent but I'm not sure what it is. It is very faint and doesn't smell anything like the typical self-tanning products (from drug store version to high end version, they all have a tell tale scent.)  After an hour or so, the scent seemed a bit stronger, but was still mild compared with the typical self tanner scent and certainly wasn't enough to make me self conscious.\n\nI tested on my forearms and hands, and after about 3-4 hours, my skin had a nice, fresh glow. The product itself is white, a mix between a rich, thick cream and a lotion that easily blends into the skin. It dries fairly quickly; the first application I used a bit too much on my right arm and it took longer to dry fully to the touch (around 30 min.) I was more careful with my left arm and used half the amount - about 1.5 dime size of product on the second arm. It blends easily, but no matter what product I use or how careful I am, I always have at least a few streaks. The streaks this time were on my fingers, which is always a hard area to cover to ensure you get the backs but not fronts of the fingers.\n\nThe second application helped to easily cover up my streaks.

I couldn't run out and buy a new can of hair spray and I had to borrow some from the bride!!! Never again.\n\n***************** Original Review below **************************************************\nI use hair spray every single day and I have been trying to find a single good brand that does the job off my current two brands. I have settled on Suave for the days when I am outside with the horses in the wind, dust and humidity simply because it is inexpensive and my hair stays put. But the trade off is I can't run a brush through my hair after spraying it and it can get dry in the summer. My second option has been Fekkai brand which is excellent, smells pretty, and holds well, yet feels soft & I can brush my hair and it still looks great. But....Fekkai is outrageously overpriced and hard to justify & the nozzles don't always work.\n\nThis CHI Keratin has a mild and not unpleasant scent, sprays out in a wide, fine mist and doesn't feel sticky. My hair feels soft and looks nice - the same way it does with the Fekkai and I can brush it for touch ups. If I use a bit more than when I use the Suave, I get a similar strong hold in a wind outside and humidity. On a normal day or if I am going to be inside only, a light spritz of the CHI is all I need.

It's kind of a fun product to use because of the colors (green, with black kiwi seeds) and texture (very light and almost whipped) but I'm just not seeing the results I expect.\n\nPart of the problem is that the exfoliating particles (the seeds, presumably) are not very dense in this product.  You can feel them going over your skin and if there were more of them, I think my opinion of this product would be different.  But as it is now, a large percentage of your skin is never going to come into contact with one of the seeds as you use this, so most of your skin will not be exfoliated.  Since this is marketed as a scrub, that's a problem.\n\nThis is gentle and non-irritating when used a few times a week.  If you have sensitive skin and have had trouble with microdermabrasion-type scrubs, this could still work for you.  Please note that it has alpha hydroxy acids and so should be used in combination with a sunscreen.  It does rinse off cleanly and without leaving residue, as well.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm having more breakouts with this than before I used it.  I don't necessarily think it is causing the breakouts, but the less-effective exfoliation (as opposed to my previous scrub product) is slowing turnover of my skin cells, which is what's causing my problems.\n\nIn the end, this may be worth a try if you have really sensitive skin.

Also, having to use the brush to go over hair several times means it frizzed my roots a bit. Worst part of ColorWow is it transfers to your hands esp fingernails if you touch your hair. I didn't realize how much I touch my hair until this product. After a while, it made me look forward to washing it out. To help others on their quest, I'll note that I've tried two other products. ColorMark, which is like a marker, is ok but after applying enough to cover silver in some spots it got a bit cakey. So so coverage otherwise and time consuming. For me the first thing I bought at Bed Bath and Beyond, EverPro Gray Away, which is what I call a colored hairspray is the easiest and provides best coverage. Not sure of color match if my hair wasn't dark brown/black. But works best for me without grit or cake build up, quick application, and fairly full coverage.

I was prepared to be bowled over by an ungodly stench, but it smells gourd-like, like a fermenting melon, not too bad.\n\nI'm definitely noticing my skin aging, loss of elasticity, enlarged pores, inability to retain moisture. I've purchased and used expensive products like La Mer, Shiseido even straight vaseline. I started using this a few weeks ago. I can't properly describe the effect, but after putting it on, a bit of a tingle or sting usually accompanies it, but my skin feels protected by it. It seems to stay on the surface, and it feels binding. My skin looks smoother, plumper and seems to appear more wholesome. I don't know if that makes sense, but I like the way it feels. I don't know if the effects are lasting, but I'll continue to use it up and if my skin retains a more youthful appearance then I'll definitely buy more.\n\nI know some people are opposed to the ingredients, but seriously, cosmetics have a notorious past of blinding bunnies and torturing kittens.

When I hold the measuring tape up next to the barrel it measures 3/4\".  My hairdresser cut my layers a tad too short last time so my mistake worked in my favor. I'd be burning myself quite often if I was using the 1\" size.\n\nI have a 1\" Hot Tool curing iron, just like this one, that I've been using for over 6 years. My husband replaced the plug once because I had to keep wiggling the cord & plug to get everything in the proper place for the curling iron to stay on. Recently I began having problems with the cord again, but this time it's where the cord attaches to the handle & that is why I was ordering another curling iron. This new design is supposed to prevent that problem...only time will tell. I will update my review if necessary.\n\nThese irons come with two extra springs...I didn't have to use the extra springs with my old one, but I'm very happy the extras are included. (We've had to replace the springs in other curling irons I've owned through the years. It was never easy to find a replacement spring). The temperature settings/numbers eventually wore off of my old one & I'm expecting this one to do the same because they're applied in the same manner. I have a favorite setting.  I marked my old one with a silver permanent marker so I'd know which setting to use. Although these curling irons get very, very hot I do not & will not use the higher settings. For goodness sakes, my hair isn't made from asbestos. FYI: My hairdresser recently burned a section of my hair off when her curling iron was set too hot. Thankfully, it was in a hidden spot, I don't have long layers, and I was able to cover the burned off hair until it grew back. Anyway, let that be a warning to you...it can happen. I've used curling irons for years & years & years & that was a first for me & my hairdresser.  I use the #7 temperature. It's the first setting on the 'Extra Hot' category. My baby fine hair is extremely hard to curl. If this curling iron lives up to its predecessor, I can expect many more useful years out of it.  And, soon, I will be placing an order for the 1\" size.\n\nGreat curling iron!"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-76308", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Wow.

Unfortunately this product fell short of my expectations.\n\nMy single largest gripe is the color: this product can be best described as an orange-inspired metallic bronze. Considering the purpose of the product, I thought perhaps the orange hue would fade into my skin tone when applied (which is classified as medium with orange undertones). Sadly, it doesn't. I applied it to one side of my face and the orange hue completely took over and never really blended in.\n\nAll in all it just wasn't for me.

The batteries in the alpha fit & mia fit 2 are terrible and usually don't last much past the warranty period.  However, these brushes can be fixed with a couple rechargeable AAA nimh batteries. Please keep in mind that doing this is at your own risk....\nThere is a rubber plug on the bottom of the brush that can be easily popped out with a small screw driver or other similar object. Once removed, there is a screw that needs to be removed. This will allow the brush to come apart. There is a little bit of adhesive between the plastic and metal ring. Take a small screw driver and gently go around too loosen the top. Don't pry or jab anything, as there is a gasket /o-ring and housing that can be damaged and ruin the water proofing. Scrape off the excess adhesive. Once once apart, note the position of the rubber band that goes around the internals. This band will probably shift when working on the unit, so you'll just want to make sure you get it or back in place before reassembly. Now you will need to cut the zip tie that holds the batteries in place(This won't come out until the batteries are removed). You can gently pry the metal clips off the batteries with needle nose pliers. This can take some time. If you rush and do not do it slow and gentle you will most likely break the metal clips. If the clips break, you will most likely need to solder replacement wires to the main board, as they will probably not be long enough to reach the batteries. I used a small piece of copper wire to solder the bottom of the new batteries (- to +). Don't use a thick wire on the bottom of the batteries, it is unnecessary and could  take up too much space, causing the batteries to not fit properly in the brush. Place the new batteries into position in the brush. You should be able to reuse the plastic wrap from the original batteries to the help keep them together. However, you can use some electrical tape as an alternative. Electrical tape can make a snug fit in the battery holder, which should hold them in place so you don't need to use new zip ties; I chose to put in new zip ties. Now, solder the positive & negative wires to the tops of the new batteries. Once done, put everything back together. You may want to add additional sealant to make sure it stays water tight. I added a small silicon layer to the top edge of the lower plastic casing. When putting back together the metal ring should meet this. Silicon will squeeze out. Wipe off any excess.

That lightness makes it easy to smooth on the face.  The downside to that: it's so light that it doesn't impart much moisture at all.  This would be great for someone who doesn't have particularly dry skin, but for those of us who need a big dose of moisture, this doesn't work for that.  For those who benefit from light moisturization, be prepared for how this product gives you that: in my experience, after it's smoothed on, it leaves a lightly tacky, even greasy feel to the skin.\n\nThe scent has gotten a lot of mentions in reviews, and there is a reason for that.  I thought it would be fine for me even though I'm very sensitive to strong aromas because \"parfum/fragrance\" is the last item on the ingredient list.  Initially, it seems to have a lovely, light rose scent.  However, that scent doesn't dissipate at all - it just sits there on your face, and for me, it became cloying and eventually overwhelming.  By the time I'd had it on for about a half hour, I'd begun to develop a headache and had to wash it off.  (Side note: it didn't come off easily at all with just water; this is the kind of product that requires some kind of cleanser to totally remove.)\n\nThe packaging is nice, in terms of the inside of the box having diagrams and instructions for application of the product, and the jar is quite pretty with a useful mirror serving as the top of the lid.  The downside here, though, is that this obviously requires you to dip your fingers into the product in order to then apply it to your face; as such, even with clean hands, eventually bacteria could start to be a concern, so I would have preferred if the cream had come in a pump-form.\n\nThe aspects of the product that don't have \"cons\" - it's paraben free, and even though my skin is highly sensitive, I didn't experience any irritation when I put this on my face.  (However, it is worth noting again that I could only tolerate having it on my skin for a half hour because of the fragrance.)\n\nIt's been so difficult - actually it's been impossible, thus far - for me to find a moisturizer/cream that won't irritate my sensitive skin and won't make my extreme sensitivity to fragrance come into play.  This product will likely work for people who don't have to deal with those things and don't require a product that delivers a lot of moisture.  For all of those like me who are on a quest for an effective, non-irritating, non-aggravating moisturizer, the search continues."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-52803", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Not worth the price, streaky and doesn't fade naturally.

The batteries in the alpha fit & mia fit 2 are terrible and usually don't last much past the warranty period.  However, these brushes can be fixed with a couple rechargeable AAA nimh batteries. Please keep in mind that doing this is at your own risk....\nThere is a rubber plug on the bottom of the brush that can be easily popped out with a small screw driver or other similar object. Once removed, there is a screw that needs to be removed. This will allow the brush to come apart. There is a little bit of adhesive between the plastic and metal ring. Take a small screw driver and gently go around too loosen the top. Don't pry or jab anything, as there is a gasket /o-ring and housing that can be damaged and ruin the water proofing. Scrape off the excess adhesive. Once once apart, note the position of the rubber band that goes around the internals. This band will probably shift when working on the unit, so you'll just want to make sure you get it or back in place before reassembly. Now you will need to cut the zip tie that holds the batteries in place(This won't come out until the batteries are removed). You can gently pry the metal clips off the batteries with needle nose pliers. This can take some time. If you rush and do not do it slow and gentle you will most likely break the metal clips. If the clips break, you will most likely need to solder replacement wires to the main board, as they will probably not be long enough to reach the batteries. I used a small piece of copper wire to solder the bottom of the new batteries (- to +). Don't use a thick wire on the bottom of the batteries, it is unnecessary and could  take up too much space, causing the batteries to not fit properly in the brush. Place the new batteries into position in the brush. You should be able to reuse the plastic wrap from the original batteries to the help keep them together. However, you can use some electrical tape as an alternative. Electrical tape can make a snug fit in the battery holder, which should hold them in place so you don't need to use new zip ties; I chose to put in new zip ties. Now, solder the positive & negative wires to the tops of the new batteries. Once done, put everything back together. You may want to add additional sealant to make sure it stays water tight. I added a small silicon layer to the top edge of the lower plastic casing. When putting back together the metal ring should meet this. Silicon will squeeze out. Wipe off any excess. Now put the screw and rubber cap back.

First disappointment was that I must have selected the one Oribe product that smells like, well, wax.  No beautiful scents, supposedly originating from the same lab that Tom Ford concocted his amazing perfumes, for this product.  Additionally, I found the wax difficult to work with (i.e., really challenging to get it out of the container and spread throughout my palms without chunks of it falling on the floor).  Finally, I hated that it made my hair hard and crunchy once applied.  It held it alright, but I don't care for spiky hair.  I realize many people like a product that does this for them.  What can I say? This product would work for you.  And although it had maximum hold, I needed to wash my hair and restyle every day in order to have the product hold the same way it did upon first application.  I have really short hair and can go three days without washing and still have my hair look, smell and feel good.  I don't want to wash my hair every day and reapply product in order to style my hair the right way.  I will say that I liked that the product was \"formulated without sodium chloride\" and is \"color and keratin treatment safe.\"  Additional plus, it states that it has \"UV protection for hair.\"  Can tell that it is a quality product, it just didn't provide the two big factors, heavenly scent and medium (not stiff) hold, for which, I was willing to pay $30 for 1.7 oz.(!)

I have recommended them to clients with skin sensitivities and in most cases they have been very happy with their performance.  Once in a while, however, I come across a product which I am not as fond of.  This, unfortunately, happens to be one of them.\n\nWHAT IS THIS CLEANSER LIKE?\nA nice sized bottle, I do like the color of the cleanser.  It reminds me of pistachio ice cream.  The texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick.  It has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed.  The fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me, however.  I am not sure what it is.  It just is not a smell that I enjoy a whole lot.  The label stays on and does not come off like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mario-Badescu-The-Moisture-Magnet-SPF-15-2-oz/dp/B0015Z532O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mario Badescu The Moisture Magnet SPF 15, 2 oz.</a>.\n\nHOW DOES THIS CLEANSING SOAP PERFORM?\nA little goes  along way of this stuff.  It is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  The cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  It does make skin soft at first, but then I feel as if the skin is too stripped.  The time that I am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, I am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  I have normal to dry skin.\n\nI have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.\n\nIn both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.\n\nI have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.\n\nTHE WORST PART- ITCHING\nThe worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  Perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  No matter how much lotion I apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nGreat sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.\n\nI have given this one star.  If you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.  For us, it really is rough on our skin and it just leaves us too uncomfortable to rate it higher than that."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-10653", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Slightly unnerving that this product comes with a cancer warning.

I like the idea of an adjustable razor because I'm prone to cut myself in predictable places when shaving, and parts of my face are more \"tender\" than others. Other than the adjustability, there's not a lot I like about this razor. First and most important, it is too big, and it is needlessly overweight. The problem with the size is that the head is too big to have good control over margins around my beard. I have a goatee and when I tried to shave right up the edge of my beard, I can't see what I'm doing. The razor is so heavy that you have little feel for what is going on at the cutting edge.  I also have a Merkur 180 and when I finish shaving I like to loosen the head to blow out any residual water. I've found this greatly extends the life of the blade because most of the dulling of the blade comes from micro-oxidation (rust) and not from cutting the hair. To blow out water from the head of the Future, you have to completely pop the top off which causes the blade to want to jump dangerously out. I recommend the Merkur 180 over the Future because of size, weight and control over the instrument, not to mention the big difference in price. I'm going to continue to work with the Futur because it cost too much to just set it aside completely. I want to get my money's worth out of it.

I normally purchase it in person from the salon I visit regularly.  My hair is always silky smooth and great smelling and therefore I have no qualms about paying the money I do for it 'cause frankly I think it's worth it.  About a month ago I ran out of my beloved Drench right before going on vacation.  Short on time to make the drive to my salon to purchase another bottle, I jumped on Amazon.com to take advantage of my prime membership perks (free 2 day shipping) and a slightly lower price.  I was estatic when I received my bottle of Drench but after using it for some time I noticed my hair felt dry, brittle and had a weird chemical smell equivalent to the smell of gasoline.  My hair became unmanagable, dull and lifeless.  It felt thick with buildup.  Not healthy and not shiny (what I'm used to with Drench).  Needless to say, I became very suspicious of the product I purchased online.  Even my scalp suffered horribly and become very tender and red.  I experienced a tingly, burning sensation after every use.  Well, last night I decided I had enough of this bottle and went into the salon to purchase my shampoo in person.  After washing my hair with this new bottle of Drench, my hair is back to smelling great, feeling silky smooth, looking shiny and feeling healthy.  I am 100% positive it was the shampoo I purchased online.  Just a word to the wise, if you read the guarantee on the bottle, it says it's only guaranteed when purchased from a licensed salon.  I am very skeptical that the product I bought here online is even legit.  After comparing the two bottles, I finally noticed the difference.  The bottle I purchased from the salon has a lot number/product number on the bottom of the bottle and the one I bought from Amazon does not.  Just be careful folks, I feel like I was sold a fake bottle of Sebastian Drench.

I would NOT be using this hot roller set if I wanted CURLS! They take forever to heat up, there's not enough clips, I've notice all the rollers on top get hotter than the ones at the bottom row, and for the price you would expect more but it's bs. Im only keeping this becuz I am new to hot rollers, want to style my hair everyday without using an actual iron that heats up to idk like 450 degrees. And despite the fact that it doesn't really give you curls at least my hair will still be style than that ugly plain straight hair I've got. P.s the clips might hold well but are so cheap. One broke on the first day I got them! I also bought the conair multiple set which is the hot pink one. It works SO MUCH better than this one! Takes less than 1 min to heat up and curls last ALL DAY!\n\nUpdate 10/15/14\nThe other day I started using this hot roller set again. This time I let it heat up to an hour becuz my hair is very thick, mean while it's heating up I start spraying my hair with heat protector and strong finish sprays. When I am rolling up my hair, I actually take smaller sections and end up having like a million hot rollers in my hair, which looks ridiculous but is so fun at the same time and Im only at home so who cares! While they are settling in my hair, I take a lighter hair spray and use it all over. Wait a good 30-40 mins then I take them out. Soon as I finish taking them out I spray my hair with the strongest hairspray I have, and then shake/pick the curls out and one final last spray with a light one.
