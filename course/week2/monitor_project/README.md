# Week 2 Project: Monitoring distribution shift

```
pip install -e .

This project will have learners monitor deep learning systems for distribution shift using their predictions.

### Download dataset

In your terminal, please run
```
pip install gdown
```
Then, run the following:
```
gdown --id 1hdwWYFNJiCI_zFHWTMce6TETyj20GHG9
