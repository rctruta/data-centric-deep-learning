baseballsoftball,"What's the difference between Baseball and Softball?

While there are world championships for both men and women in both sports, at the Olympic level baseball has been a men's-only sport while softball has been a women's-only sport. There are differences in the number of players on each team between the two sports, the size of the field, and in some rules.

Softball pitchers are also required to throw underhand, and most pitchers throw using the windmill pitch style, where the ball is thrown after rotating in a large circle. In softball, top female pitchers can reach speeds of over 100km/h. That speed fits with the fast-paced nature of the game. Since the bases aren’t as far apart, there is a shorter pitching distance. The game is also shorter in duration to baseball, with only seven innings compared to baseball’s nine.",What is the maximum number of players allowed on a baseball team versus a softball team?,4,"The maximum number of players allowed on a baseball team is typically 25 players, while the maximum number of players allowed on a softball team is usually 15 players."
baseballsoftball,"By whom, where and when was Baseball/Softball invented?

The earliest record of the game of ""baseball"" being played was in Surrey, England, in 1749. The sport made it to the United States by the 1770s, and the first organised professional league—the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players—was founded in 1875. Baseball is considered ""America's past-time"".

Softball was first imagined as “indoor baseball” in 1887 in Chicago, Illinois, by reporter George Hancock after watching someone hit a boxing glove with a broom handle. He went on to publish rules for the game and later took it outside, playing on fields too small for baseball. While the rules remained vague, interest in the game grew, and more than 100 area high school teams were formed by 1892.

In 1895, firefighters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, played a similar game named “kitten ball” using a ball of yarn wrapped in leather. In 1907, a guide for indoor baseball published by Albert Spalding allowed for game flexibility with two constants: a larger ball than baseball as well as underhand pitching. In 1926, Walter Hakanson proposed unifying the disparate versions of the game into one, under a single name: Softball.",Who invented Softball?,4,George Hancock is credited with inventing softball in Chicago on Thanksgiving Day in 1887.
baseballsoftball,"What are the rules of Baseball/Softball?

Two teams of nine players aim to score the most runs by striking a ball and running round a sequence of bases to reach the home plate.

The teams rotate between batting and fielding, with each session called an inning, and switch when the fielding team gets three opposition players out.

The pitcher throws the ball from a mound toward the catcher which the batter attempts to hit and get around the bases to the home plate.

Softball is similar but features 9 or 10 players per team, depending on the style being played. The basic rules are the same.",How many players are typically on each team in a game of softball?,5,There are typically 9 players on each team in a game of softball.
baseballsoftball,"How long is a Baseball/Softball game?

A baseball game lasts for nine innings, while softball lasts for seven innings. There are three outs per half-inning (teams rotate batting and fielding each half-inning). Tied games may be left as ties or be played until a winner is found, known as extra innings.

Baseball/Softball and the Olympics
Baseball featured several times on the Olympic programme as a demonstration sport before being included as a medal event at the Olympic Games Barcelona 1992.

Cuba won the gold medal on the sport’s competitive debut and three times in total before it was removed from the programme following the Olympic Games Beijing 2008.

Softball was introduced at the Olympic Games Atlanta 1996 as a women-only medal sport, with the United States winning the sport’s inaugural gold medal. They won the subsequent two titles and enjoyed a 22-game winning streak from September 2000 before they were beaten by Japan in the final in 2008.

Originally considered separate sports at the Olympics, baseball softball made its return as a combined sport with two distinct events (men's baseball and women's softball) at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, where hosts Japan won both gold medals.",How many innings are played in a softball game compared to a baseball game?,5,"In general, a softball game consists of 7 innings, while a baseball game consists of 9 innings."

lacrosse,"By whom, where and when was Lacrosse invented?

Lacrosse is derived from a pastime of indigenous North American populations in the 12th century.

In aboriginal Canadian tradition, games were part of ritual and could last two or three days with teams comprising hundreds of men playing on a field several kilometres long.

Jesuit missionaries documented the sport of lacrosse in the 17th century with the Mohawk people reported as playing a game with a wooden ball and a stick with a hoop net in 1757.

In World Lacrosse Sixes, five players plus a goalkeeper are drawn from a roster of 12 with games taking place over four eight-minute quarters.

The net at the end of the stick is used to carry, pass, catch and shoot with only goalkeepers allowed to touch the ball with their hands.

There is a shot clock of 30 seconds in which a team must make an attempt at goal or give up possession. A turnover also occurs if a team returns to its own half having moved into the attacking half.

Minor fouls result in a player being sent to the penalty box for 30 seconds with major fouls triggering a one-minute suspension.

At the end of the match, the team with most goals wins. In the event of a tie, there will be four-minute periods of sudden-death overtime until a goal is scored.",What is the shot clock time limit in World Lacrosse Sixes?,5,The shot clock time limit in World Lacrosse Sixes is 35 seconds.

There are three Olympic shooting disciplines: rifle, pistol and shotgun. Rifle and pistol events take place on shooting ranges, where athletes aim at targets at distances of 10m, 25m and 50m. There are also three positions: kneeling (where the athlete goes down on one knee and rests the elbow on the other knee), prone and standing. Some events include all positions.

To hit the targets as accurately and as close to the centre (the bullseye) as possible, marksmen use relaxation techniques to lower their heartbeat. Shotgun events are different in principle, as they take place outdoors. Marksmen shoot at flying targets fired from different angles and directions. This sport demands a great deal of concentration, decision making and sharp reflexes.",What are the three Olympic shooting disciplines and their respective distances?,5,"The three Olympic shooting disciplines are rifle shooting, pistol shooting, and shotgun shooting.

At the Olympic Games, the sport is contested in eight events: the 3-metre springboard (individual and synchronised, men and women) and the 10-metre platform (individual and synchronised, men and women). The 3-metre springboard enables divers to leap high into the air, while the high dive is performed from a fixed platform position 10 metres above the water. The individual and synchronised competitions take place at both heights.

A panel of judges score each dive based on various criteria, including how aesthetically pleasing a diver’s movements are, the complexity of the dive and how well the diver enters the water. Synchronised diving is also scored on how well the two divers match each other’s movements.","What are the two types of diving events contested at the Olympic Games, and how are they different from each other in terms of height and execution?",5,"The two types of diving events contested at the Olympic Games are platform diving and springboard diving. 

Platform diving takes place from a 10-meter platform, which is the tallest height in diving competitions. This event requires divers to perform their dives with more somersaults and twists due to the higher starting point. 

Springboard diving, on the other hand, takes place from a lower height of either 1 or 3 meters, depending on the competition. Divers use the springboard to generate height and perform their dives with less somersaults and twists compared to platform diving."

beachhandball,"Beach Handball Evolution

In the late 1980s, Italian coach Simonetta Montagni began developing handball on the beach. As the discipline began to grow in popularity, coach Luciano Bartolini was asked to create the first set of rules for the game in 1990, making the fast-paced game fit within the existing beach volleyball court lines.

In 2000, beach handball became an official European Handball Federation (EHF) sport, and the first EHF Beach Handball European Championship was held that year in Gaeta, Italy. The sport was further developed with representatives of the International Handball Federation (IHF), and it began to reach a global audience. In 2004, the first Beach Handball World Championship was held in Egypt, and the first IHF under-17 World Championships were held in Mauritius in 2017.

beachhandball,"Beach and Indoor Differences

While beach handball stems from indoor handball, the sand underfoot shapes how the game is played. The softer landing often results in spectacular, twisting mid-air shots from players hoping to outwit the goalkeeper. Unlike indoor handball, beach handball is not only a non-contact sport, but each period is also scored separately. The winner of a period is awarded one point. Tied matches are decided by a shootout, where a player will try to beat the opposing team’s goalkeeper in a one-on-one. In the shootouts, each team gets five initial attempts. If the scores remained tied, sudden death decides the winner.",How is scoring different between beach handball and indoor handball?,5,"In beach handball, goals scored are worth two points if they are scored by a goalkeeper and one point if scored by a field player. In indoor handball, most goals are worth one point regardless of who scores them."
beachhandball,"The Basics

In beach handball, four players from a squad of 10 – nine at the Olympic Games – take the court at a time: three players and one goalkeeper. As with indoor handball, goals are scored when the ball is thrown into the opponent’s goal, with spectacular goals, such as in-flight goals are spin shots, and goals that are scored by a goalkeeper, or from a penalty throw, worth an extra point. Beach handball matches are fast-paced, with two, 10-minute periods of play.",How many players from a squad are on the court at a time in beach handball?,5,There are 4 players from a squad on the court at a time in beach handball.

Other than the goalkeeper, players may only hold the ball with one hand. Possession lasts 30 seconds; if the team does not attempt a shot within that time, possession passes to the opposition and the shot clock is reset.

Water polo is an intensely physical sport; contact is permitted with players possessing the ball. Strength, endurance, power and strategy are therefore essential.",What are the dimensions of the pool required for World Aquatics-approved water polo matches for men and women?,5,"The dimensions for a World Aquatics-approved water polo pool for men are 30 meters long and 20 meters wide, with a minimum depth of 1.8 meters.

athletics,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Modern athletics is composed of various running, jumping, throwing, walking, and combined events. Due to its many categories and disciplines, athletics involves the most participants in a single sport at the Olympic Games.

The track programme includes sprints, middle-distance and long-distance events as well as hurdles, steeplechase races, and relays for men and women. These events take place on the 400m oval track in the Olympic stadium (made up of two straights and two curved bends).

Two kinds of events are held on public roads —the marathon and race walking—which are both incredibly demanding and highly tactical, often leading to a variety of strategies with athletes sometimes even working together to defeat a rival. Spectators line the route to watch and cheer the athletes on.

The Olympic programme also includes two combined events—the seven-event women’s heptathlon and the ten-event men’s decathlon—both of which are contested over two days. Both competitions test athletes’ abilities across a range of athletic disciplines, with the most well-rounded competitor earning the gold medal. The disciplines are contested on, within, and around the track in the Olympic stadium, in the jumping area (high jump and pole vault), the jumping pit (long jump and triple jump), the throwing circle (shot put, discus and hammer throw), and the javelin runway. Athletes compete one after another, and the event includes a qualifying stage during which the best athletes secure their place in the final.",What are the two combined events included in the Olympic athletics programme?,5,The two combined events included in the Olympic athletics programme are the men's and women's decathlon and heptathlon.

judo,"Brief Overview of the Rules

The objective of judo is to throw your opponent to the ground, immobilise them with a pinning hold or force them into submission with a joint lock or choke. There are two types of scores in judo:

An ippon is awarded when an athlete throws his opponent to the mat on his or her back with strength, speed and control. An ippon can also be awarded through submission or by pinning an opponent to the ground for 20 seconds. If a judoka achieves ippon, they immediately win the match.

A waza-ari is awarded for a throw that isn’t clear enough to be an ippon (either because it lacked speed or force, or the opponent did not land primarily on their back) or when an   opponent is pinned down for less than 20 seconds (but longer than 10 seconds). Two waza‑ari in one match is the equivalent of an ippon and immediately ends the match.

Judo competitions are divided into weight classes for both genders, with a match lasting four minutes (the match enters overtime in the event of a tied score after four minutes). Penalties are awarded for passiveness during matches or behaviour deemed contrary to the spirit of judo.",What is the criteria for winning a judo match with an ippon?,5,"The criteria for winning a judo match with an ippon is to execute a technique that shows control, power, and efficiency resulting in a clean throw that lands the opponent flat on their back with force."

Modern pentathlon is made up of four events combining five sports:

- Riding, with a show jumping course on an unfamiliar horse that the athlete is allocated in a draw just 20 minutes before they compete.
- Fencing, which is split into two rounds: a ranking round where each athlete competes against each other athlete in a bout lasting one minute or until the first hit, and a second round based on the results of the first round. The format of the second round is single elimination, with each bout lasting 45 seconds. Points are scored for winning each bout.
- Swimming, with a 200m freestyle event.
- Running and shooting, with a laser-run where athletes alternate between running and shooting at five targets from a distance of 10m.
The modern pentathlon is divided into two sections. Firstly, athletes score points according to how they rank in the fencing, riding and swimming events, which decide their starting position for the laser run event. Secondly, during the laser-run, athletes start with a delay corresponding to the number of points between them and the leader. The first athlete to cross the finish line in the laser-run wins the gold medal.

wrestling,"Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in human history—if not the oldest. Multiple sculptures, reliefs and cave drawings—some of which date to around 15,000 years ago—show wrestlers using various holds that are still used in the present-day sport. Wrestling was a key part of the ancient Olympic Games, where it was first contested in 708 BCE. Wrestling matches were organised as its own event in two disciplines (‘upright’ and ‘ground’ wrestling) and as part of the pentathlon.

Modern wrestling consists of two separate disciplines: Greco-Roman wrestling, a wrestling style based on the ancient sport, and freestyle wrestling, a more modern format.",What are the two separate disciplines of modern wrestling?,5,The two separate disciplines of modern wrestling are Greco-Roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling.
wrestling,"Brief Overview of the Rules

There are two Olympic wrestling disciplines, each with its own rules. In Greco-Roman wrestling, a competitor can only use his arms and upper body to attack his opponent above the waist. Freestyle wrestling is a much more open form of the sport in which competitors also use their legs and can hold opponents above or below the waist.

However, the objective is the same in both styles. Contested on a circular combat area, a bout consists of two three-minute periods. Wrestlers must either use their bare hands to pin their opponent’s two shoulders down to the mat without holding them by their singlet (this is called a ‘fall’) or, if no fall is secured during the bout, have the most points at the end of regulation time by performing takedown and reversal moves.",What are the main differences between Greco-Roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling in terms of rules and techniques allowed?,4,"Greco-Roman wrestling does not allow for any attacks below the waist, while freestyle wrestling permits attacks to the legs. Additionally, Greco-Roman wrestling focuses more on upper body throws and takedowns, while freestyle wrestling incorporates both upper body and lower body techniques."

archery,"Archery is one of the oldest sports still practised today, and is closely linked to the development of human civilisation. Historically, archery has been used for hunting and warfare; the earliest evidence of its use comes from South African sites such as Sibudu Cave, where arrowheads dating from approximately 64,000 years ago have been found. The first recorded archery tournaments took place in the People's Republic of China during the Zhou dynasty (1027‑256 BC). In 1931, the sport evolved around the globe and the international archery federation—now known as World Archery—was founded.",What is the historical significance of archery in human civilization?,5,"Archery has played a significant role in human civilization throughout history, serving as a crucial tool for hunting, warfare, and sport. The use of bows and arrows dates back thousands of years, with evidence of their use in various cultures around the world. Archery was a vital skill for early humans to secure food through hunting, and it also became an essential element in warfare, allowing for long-range attacks and defense. In many ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, and East Asians, archery was highly valued and incorporated into military tactics. Additionally, archery has been a popular sport and form of recreation for centuries, with competitions dating back to ancient times. Overall, the historical significance of archery lies in its role as a versatile tool that has influenced human society in multiple ways."
archery,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Targets are 122cm in diameter and positioned 70m away from the archers, who must shoot their arrows as close to the centre of the target as possible in order to beat their opponents. Olympic archery comprises five events: two individual competitions for men and women, two team competitions (one each for men and women), and a mixed team competition, which returns to the programme after making its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020.

Archery requires great concentration and dexterity; archers must overcome their nerves as a single mistake can prove costly in competition. Individual competitions at the Games begin with the ranking round, where each of the 64 archers shoot 72 arrows to determine their ranking for the single-elimination bracket. The athletes compete in this knockout system until the final according to their ranking, with the top‑ranked archer facing off against the 64th‑ranked archer, the second‑ranked against the 63rd‑ranked, and so on.

The team event uses the same ranking results from the individual competition to determine seeding for the teams; the top four teams receive a bye into the quarterfinals, while the rest of the field competes in a single-elimination bracket. The mixed team event also uses the results of the ranking round to qualify and seed teams.",What are the dimensions of the targets in Olympic archery and how far are they positioned from the archers?,5,The targets in Olympic archery have a diameter of 122 cm (48 inches) and are positioned 70 meters (230 feet) away from the archers.

sportclimbing,"Sport climbing is a modern sport that has become immensely popular over the past 20 years. It is a young, mixed-gender sport – with 39 per cent of climbers under 18 years old – practised both outdoors and in a more urban format indoors. There are over 25 million climbers in 150 countries all over the world.

In 1985, a group of climbers gathered in Bardonecchia, near Turin, Italy, for an event called “SportRoccia”, which became the first organised lead competition in which competitors climb within a certain time limit. One year later, the first competition event on an artificial climbing wall was organised in Vaulx-en-Velin near Lyon, France.",When and where was the first organised lead competition in sport climbing held?,4,"The first organised lead competition in sport climbing was held in Bardonecchia, Italy in 1985."
sportclimbing,"Brief Overview of the Rules

At the Olympics, sport climbing involves three formats : bouldering, speed and lead. In bouldering, athletes climb 4.5 m high walls without ropes, in a limited period of time and in the fewest attempts possible. Speed is a spectacular race against the clock in one-on-one elimination rounds that combine precision and explosivity. The best athletes scale a 15m high and five degrees inclinated wall in under six seconds for men and under seven seconds for women.

In the lead event, athletes climb as high as they can on a wall over 15m high in six minutes without having seen the route ahead of time. The routes for this event are more and more complex and challenging during the event, requiring all of the athletes’ physical and mental ability.

In Tokyo, each athlete competed in all three disciplines and the final scores reflected the combined results of the three competitions. The climber with the lowest score took home the first Olympic gold medal in the history of sport climbing.

In Paris 2024, two competitions will crown their own olympic champion in sport climbing. One will be a combined competition of bouldering and lead events, and the second one will only feature a speed event.",What is the format of the sport climbing event in Tokyo and how were the final scores determined?,5,"The sport climbing event in Tokyo consisted of three disciplines: speed climbing, bouldering, and lead climbing.

rowing,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Rowing involves propelling a boat using oars fixed to the vessel. It differs from other disciplines in that rowers sit with their backs to the direction of movement, therefore crossing the finish line backwards.

Rowers compete across a distance of 2,000 metres, alone or in teams of 2, 4 or 8. There are two different disciplines: double scull and sweep rowing. In sweep events, rowers hold a single oar with both hands, while in sculling they hold one oar in each hand. The eight-person crews have a coxswain, who steers the boat and directs the crew. The boat is steered using a small rudder that is attached to the foot of one of the rowers by a cable. There are two lightweight rowing events.",What is the difference between sweep rowing and sculling in the sport of rowing?,5,"In sweep rowing, each rower has one oar, with one hand holding it on one side of the boat.

Rowing events have been staged at every Games since the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 (men’s events). However, because the competition was scheduled to take place at sea, it had to be cancelled that year due to bad weather. Women’s events were only officially included in the Olympic program much later, at the Games of Montréal in 1976.

The USA initially dominated Olympic rowing, before the Soviet Union and Germany came to the forefront.

In fencing, two competitors, each holding a weapon in one hand, face each other to strike their opponent on a valid target area of the body. The rules differ according to the type of weapon used. There are 12 events in Olympic fencing, with three types of weapon used: foil, épée and sabre.

Hits made with the point (tip), edge, or back of the blade are counted as valid in sabre, with the target area including the entire torso above the waist, as well as the head and arms. In épée and foil, fencers only score when they strike their opponent with the point of their weapon. In épée the target area covers the entire body from the mask down to the feet, while in foil the target area is the trunk only (torso, shoulders and neck).

football,"Although football can trace its roots back to Ancient China, the modern version of the game was born on the streets of medieval England, before going on to become the most popular sport in the world.

The (very) early games of football in medieval England involved a large mass of people who would attempt to drag a pig’s bladder—by any means possible—to markers at opposing ends of a town. Such events were well known for being as violent as they were popular. In the 16th century, English schools established the modern football codes, thereby transforming what were mob riots into a proper sport.","What were the early games of football in medieval England like, before the modern football codes were established in the 16th century?",4,"The early games of football in medieval England were likely more chaotic and violent compared to the modern football codes. The games were often played between neighboring villages or towns and involved large numbers of players, with very few rules governing the game. It is believed that the games involved kicking, throwing, and carrying the ball towards a designated goal, with teams trying to score points by getting the ball across the opponent's goal line. The games were often rough and rowdy, with little to no protective gear worn by the players. The lack of standardized rules and organization likely led to frequent injuries and disputes among players."

Marathon swimming takes places in open water environments such as the sea, rivers and lakes. Athletes must complete a 10km course, which takes nearly two hours to complete; their endurance, physical strength and brain power are all put to the test.

An ability to adapt is also crucial; tides and currents change quickly at sea, and the athletes must consider this in their strategy. Using the right tactics for the course and conditions is therefore key. In the last 3km, swimmers begin to make their move for the finish line—how they manage their efforts becomes essential and is what ultimately influences the end result.",What are some of the key factors that athletes must consider when competing in a marathon swimming event?,5,"Some key factors that athletes must consider when competing in a marathon swimming event include proper hydration and nutrition, pacing oneself throughout the race, maintaining proper form and technique to conserve energy, mental toughness and focus, understanding and navigating the course conditions (currents, temperature, wildlife), and wearing appropriate gear such as wetsuits or swimsuits."

Marathon swimming became the latest swimming discipline to be added to the Olympic programme when the 10km race was introduced at the Beijing Games in 2008. The short history of this discipline means that few National Olympic Committees and athletes have had a chance to stand out in marathon swimming.

Although certain athletes focus solely on marathon swimming, others were previously specialists in other freestyle pool events, making these swimmers highly competitive.

Each bout is disputed over three rounds of three minutes each for men, and four rounds of two minutes each for women. At the end of every round, each of the judges determine a winner based on the judging criteria and award the victor 10 points for the round. The loser of the round can be awarded anywhere between seven to nine points based on the level of performance in that round. After the bout ends, each judge adds up the round scores to determine a final winner.",What determines the winner of each round in Olympic boxing matches?,5,"The winner of each round in Olympic boxing matches is determined by a panel of five judges scoring each round based on criteria such as effective aggression, defense, clean punching, and ring generalship.

coastalrowing,"What are the rules of Coastal Rowing?

Beach sprint rowing races are usually 600m in total length. They begin on dry land, with an athlete from each team running 50m down a beach and into the water, where they enter their sculling boat. Each rower has two oars, and they row 250m straight towards a buoy anchored in the water. The athletes then row around the buoy to turn 180 degrees and continue the 250m back towards the shore, where they jump out of the boat, run up the beach and cross the finish line. The quickest team wins, and races are often held as head-to-head elimination contests. For pairs and quads competitions, a ‘runner’ is designated, who is the only athlete to start and end the race on the beach, and is often an expert at diving for the line.",What is the total length of a beach sprint rowing race in Coastal Rowing?,5,The total length of a beach sprint rowing race in Coastal Rowing is typically around 500 meters.

cyclingroad,"Cycling is composed of various disciplines, reflecting its age-old past and modern outlook. Road cycling is the earliest form of the sport. During the 19th century, cycling enjoyed a surge in popularity thanks to the invention of the chain-and-gearing system. The first races were organised a few years later, with the first documented event held in 1868 in Parc de Saint Cloud in Paris. Shortly thereafter, national cycling federations began to be established and an international federation, known as the Union Cycliste Internationale, was set up in 1900 to oversee the organisation of the various disciplines.",When was the first documented cycling race held?,5,"The first documented cycling race was held on May 31, 1868 at the Parc de Saint-Cloud in Paris, France."
cyclingroad,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Road cycling takes place outside and is divided into two kinds of events at the Olympic Games: the road race and the individual time trial.

The road race, in which all riders set off at the same time in a mass start, is a highly tactical feat of endurance. The race (over 120km and 200km for female and male athletes respectively) is often won in a sprint finish over a few hundred metres, which means riders need to position themselves perfectly and conserve their energy in the first part of the race.

The time trial is a solo effort in which competitors set off at staggered times rather than in a grouped peloton. They cover a much shorter distance than that of the road race, as the time trial rarely exceeds 50km. Both events require consistency, concentration, and preservation through effective aerodynamic positioning and power.",What are the two kinds of events in road cycling at the Olympic Games and how do they differ in terms of format and distance?,5,"The two kinds of events in road cycling at the Olympic Games are road race and individual time trial. 

The road race is a mass start event where all the riders start together and complete a course of varying distance, typically around 240 km for men and 130 km for women, with the first rider to cross the finish line declared the winner.

The individual time trial is a race against the clock where riders start individually at set intervals and complete a course of around 44 km for men and 22 km for women. The fastest rider to complete the course wins the event."

Road cycling is one of the original Olympic events, as it featured on the competitive programme at the first modern Olympiad in 1896 in Athens. However, the discipline would be left out of the next three Olympiads before making a return at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm with the time trial. Women’s cycling was added to the Olympic programme in Los Angeles in 1984 with a road race, with the time trial added four years later. Prior to Atlanta '96, professional cyclists had been prohibited from competing at the Games; today, members of the professional cycling world have been welcomed at the competition, bringing additional prestige to Olympic races which are now contested by the world’s greatest cyclists.",When was women's cycling added to the Olympic programme?,5,Women's cycling was added to the Olympic programme in 1984.

shorttrackspeedskating,"North American Origin

Short track (or indoor) speed skating began in Canada and the United States of America, where they held mass-start competitions on an oval track as early as 1905-1906. The lack of 400m long tracks led many North American skaters to practice on ice rinks. However, practicing on a smaller track brought new challenges, like tighter turns and shorter straightaways, which lead to different techniques in order to win on a shorter track. These countries began competing against each other on an annual basis. The sport’s rise in popularity was partly thanks to the North American racing rules, which introduced a “pack” style of racing. Capitalising on this, the organisers of the 1932 Lake Placid Games, with the consent of the International Skating Union (ISU), agreed to follow these rules for the programme’s speed skating events.","What style of racing did the North American countries introduce to speed skating competitions, leading to the sport's rise in popularity?",5,Short track speed skating

flagfootball,"What are the rules of Flag Football?

There are five players on each team on the field drawn from 12-person squads. Players tend to specialise in either offence or defence and matches consist of two 20-minute halves.

A flag football pitch measures 70 x 30 yards (64m x 27.4m) with 10 yards (9.1m) allotted to each of the two endzones.

Play starts at the team's own five-yard line with the centre snapping the ball back to the quarterback who either passes the ball forward to try and find a receiver, or hands off to a running back.

The play is over when either a flag is removed, the ball-carrier goes out of bounds, or a forward pass hits the ground.

The team on offence has four attempts - known as downs - to go from their own five-yard line to halfway. If successful, they have another four downs to reach the endzone and score a touchdown. If unsuccessful on either count, the ball is turned over to the opposition who start on their own five-yard line.

After a touchdown, worth six points, teams go for an extra point - by running or passing - from the five-yard line, or two extra points from the 10-yard line.

If the scores are tied after 40 minutes, sudden-death overtime begins with the first team to score taking victory.","How many players are on each team in a game of flag football, and what is the size of the pitch?",5,"In flag football, each team typically has 5 to 8 players on the field at a time.

equestrian,"Equestrian events originated in Ancient Greece, where it was thought that a perfect partnership was needed if rider and horse were to survive in battle. Dressage was therefore developed as a way of training horses for war. Equestrian events appeared at the ancient Olympic Games as chariot racing, which was a daring and exciting spectacle. The art of riding then fell into oblivion until its revival during the Renaissance. Dressage reached its peak with the creation of the world-famous Spanish Riding School in Vienna in 1729, which established the foundations of the modern discipline.",How did dressage originate and evolve as a form of training horses for war?,5,"Dressage originated from the military in ancient times, particularly with the Greeks and the Romans. It evolved as a form of training horses for war through the refinement of movements and precision required for combat.

Equestrian comprises three disciplines at the Games, with men and women competing on equal terms.

In the jumping discipline, riders and horses are timed as they jump over obstacles, with time penalties imposed for each obstacle toppled. Agility, technique and harmony between horse and rider are essential.

Dressage is the most advanced form of horse training, where horse and rider perform a series of artistic movements to music. Judges evaluate the ease and fluidity with which they move around the course.

The third discipline of eventing resembles an equestrian triathlon.

weightlifting,"Olympic History

Weightlifting featured at the first modern Olympic Games held in Athens in 1896. Excluded from the Olympic programme for a few editions of the Games (1900, 1908 and 1912), weightlifting was reintroduced in 1920 at the Antwerp Games and has been included ever since. A women’s competition was first held at the Sydney 2000 Games.

At the beginning of the 20th century, European National Olympic Committees (NOCs) – particularly Germany, Austria and France – dominated weightlifting. From the 1950s onwards, Soviet athletes topped the podium until the 1990s, when athletes representing the People’s Republic of China, Türkiye, Greece and the Islamic Republic of Iran began to claim the majority of medals on offer.

cricket,"Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport where the batting side tries to score as many runs as possible while the bowling side attempts to get batters out, also known as taking wickets, and restrict the flow or runs.

Cricket bats are constructed from high-grade willow with balls made of leather stitched onto a cork core.

cricket,"By whom, where and when was Cricket invented?

Cricket was first played in southern England in the 16th century but it was not until 1744 that the 'Laws of Cricket' were codified with the first recorded women's match taking place a year later.

Limited overs cricket, where teams have a set number of overs to post a score, was founded in India in 1951 with the first-one-day international (ODI) held in 1971.

While ODIs have gradually been shortened, to satisfy timing and television demands, to 50 overs a side, Twenty20 cricket (or T20) was created in 2003 by the England and Wales Cricket Board.

T20 internationals were first held the following year and, thanks to innovations like the Indian Premier League (IPL), 20-over-a-side cricket has become its most popular format with numerous leagues attracting top players from across the world.",When were the 'Laws of Cricket' first codified?,4,The 'Laws of Cricket' were first codified in 1744.
cricket,"What are the rules of Cricket?

Each team has 11 players with one side batting and the other fielding. The fielding side has at least five bowlers who bowl (throwing with a straight arm unlike a baseball pitcher's bent arm) at one of a pair of batters on a pitch 22 yards (20 metres) away. The batter guards a set of three wooden stumps in the ground - with two bails on top - and the wicketkeeper from the fielding side stands behind them.

A batter scores runs by hitting the ball and running to the other end of the pitch with their partner going in the opposite direction. If they score an odd number of runs, their partner faces the next ball. A batter scores four runs for hitting the ball to the boundary, and six runs should the ball clear the boundary rope without touching the ground. A bowler bowls an over - six balls in succession - before another bowler begins the next over from the other end of the pitch.

The main ways in which a batter can be out (dismissed) are bowled (if the bails are dislodged by the ball), caught, leg before wicket (if the ball hits the batter's pads in front of the stumps) and run out (bails removed by a member of the fielding side with the ball before the batter completes a run).

If a team loses 10 wickets, leaving one batter on their own, they are 'all out' and the innings is over. In T20, the innings is usually complete at the end of 20 overs. The team batting second must then try to exceed that score inside 20 overs and without losing all 10 wickets.

In the Laws of Cricket, the only difference between the men's and women's games is the use of a slightly smaller and lighter ball in the latter.",What are the main ways a batter can be dismissed in a game of Cricket?,5,"The main ways a batter can be dismissed in a game of Cricket are:

volleyball,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Volleyball is played by two teams of six players on an indoor court 18m long and 9m wide. Matches are played to the best of five sets. A point is scored when the ball lands within the court boundaries or when a playing error is made. The first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin wins the set, with each match following a best-of-five sets format. If required, a fifth set is played to 15 points (a winning margin of two points is still required). 

In a game of volleyball, the ball can reach speeds of up to 130km/h, particularly following a spectacular jump serve or smash. Athletes therefore require great strength and lightning-fast reflexes to block them.",What is the format for scoring in a volleyball match?,5,"In volleyball, matches are typically played in a best of five sets format. Each set is played until a team reaches 25 points, with a minimum winning margin of two points. If the match reaches a fifth set, it is played until 15 points, also with a minimum winning margin of two points. Teams must win three sets to win the match."
volleyball,"Olympic History

Volleyball made its Olympic debut at the Tokyo 1964 Games. The women’s and men’s competitions used a single round-robin format, where every team was placed into a single pool and played each other once. This system remained in place until the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich; the format was switched to a pool round and final round of quarter‑finals, semi-finals and a final to determine the medal winners.

Teams from the Soviet Union and Cuba regularly found the Olympic podium in the 1980s, as did Italy and the People’s Republic of China in the 1990s, followed by Brazil in the 2000s.

karate,"What are the different types of Karate? What are the rules of Karate?

Karate comprises two modalities: Kumite and Kata. In Kumite, or combat, the winner of the three-minute fights is the one who obtains a clear lead of eight points, or the competitor having the highest number of points at time-up. If the fight is a draw, then the winner is determined by the first unopposed point advantage (Senshu) or in the case of a scoreless result, by a majority decision of the judges (Hantei).

Points are scored according to correctly-executed techniques of controlled punches, strikes and kicks.

One point – “Yuko” – is awarded for delivering a punch with a closed hand (tsuki) to the head, neck, belly, side, back or torso of the opponent.

Two points – “Waza-ari” – are awarded for a kick to the body.

Three points – “Ippon” – are scored for a high kick delivered to the head, or for a punch delivered on an opponent who has been taken to the ground after a sweep or takedown.

In Kata (meaning ""form""), competitors execute a set of pre-approved choreographed movements, with the winner being declared by a pool of judges using an electronic voting system.

Karateka are evaluated according to technical and athletic performances.",What are the scoring rules in Kumite (combat) karate matches?,5,"In Kumite (combat) karate matches, points are awarded for clean and controlled strikes to specific target areas on the body.
